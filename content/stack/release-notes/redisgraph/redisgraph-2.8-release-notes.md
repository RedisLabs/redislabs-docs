## v2.8 GA (v2.8.8) (February 2022)

This is the General Availability release of RedisGraph 2.8.

### Highlights

RedisGraph 2.8 introduces multi-labeled nodes, indexes over relationship properties, additional expressivity (construct, functions, and operators), major performance enhancements, and many bug fixes.

#### What's new in 2.8

- Multi-labeled nodes

    {{<note>}}
The `labels` function's signature has changed. The function now returns a list of labels instead of a single label.
<br /><br />
If you are using this function and upgrading to RedisGraph 2.8, a simple fix is to replace any call to `labels(x)` with `labels(x)[0]`. This returns the first label associated with node `x`. For uni-labeled nodes, the result in RedisGraph 2.8 is similar to the results of `labels(x)` in RedisGraph 2.4.
    {{</note>}}
  
- Indexes over relationship properties
- Enhanced full-text search
- Delta matrices: node and relationships additions and deletions are much faster, as they are first updated in small delta matrices. The main matrices are then bulk-updated.
- Additional Cypher construct, functions, and operators
- [RediSearch](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/) 2.2.7
- [SuiteSparse](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/GraphBLAS) (GraphBLAS) 6.0.0
