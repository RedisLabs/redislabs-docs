{{%expand "Can my Redis database grow infinitely?" %}}
Our proxy-based architecture and Dynamic Clustering technology were built from the ground up to provide scalable Redis, and to support its commands and data types at any dataset size. All you need to do is select a plan that fits your dataset’s size. If your dataset is expected to grow or occasionally varies in size, we recommend you select our Pay-As-You-Go plan, for which we charge according to your actual consumption of memory in GB/hr.

{{%expand "Why do you recommend mapping my availability zone on AWS?" %}}
The same AWS availability zone name, when shown in different AWS accounts, does not always refer to the same underlying physical infrastructure.

The mapping process lets us unambiguously identify your availability zone, so we can serve your Redis data from the same physical zone, minimizing inter-zone latencies.

{{%expand "Are my dataset/setup/endpoints be affected if I upgrade or downgrade my subscription?" %}}
No. Any changes you make to your Redis Cloud Essentials subscription are purely administrative and do not affect service to your application in any way. You can downgrade or upgrade your subscription at any time with no downtime or performance impact.
