On the **Database** \> **Slow Log** page, you can view Slow Log details
for Redis Enterprise Software (RS) databases.

[Redis Slow Log](http://redis.io/commands/slowlog) is one of the best
tools for debugging and tracing your Redis database, especially if you
experience high latency and high CPU usage with Redis operations.
Because Redis is based on a single threaded architecture, Redis Slow Log
can be much more useful than slow log mechanisms of multi-threaded
database systems such as MySQL Slow Query Log.

Unlike tools that introduce lock overhead (which complicates the debugging
process), Redis Slow Log is highly effective at showing the actual processing time of each command.

Redis Enterprise Software includes enhancements to the standard Redis
Slow Log capabilities that allow you to analyze the execution time
complexity of each command. This enhancement can help you better analyze
Redis operations, allowing you to compare the differences between
execution times of the same command, observe spikes in CPU usage, and
more.

This is especially useful with complex commands such as
[ZUNIONSTORE](http://redis.io/commands/zunionstore),
[ZINTERSTORE](http://redis.io/commands/zinterstore) and
[ZRANGEBYSCORE](http://redis.io/commands/zrangebyscore).

The enhanced RS Slow Log adds the **Complexity Info** field to the
output data.

View the Complexity Info data by its respective Command in the table
below:

| Command | Value of interest | Complexity |
