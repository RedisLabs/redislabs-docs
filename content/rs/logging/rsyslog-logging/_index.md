This document explains the structure of Redis Enterprise Software log entries in `rsyslog` and how to use these log entries to identify events.

{{<note>}}
You can also [secure your logs]({{<relref "/rs/logging/log-security.md">}}) with a remote logging server and log rotation.

## Log concepts

Redis Enterprise Software logs information from a variety of components in response to actions and events that occur within the cluster.

In some cases, a single action, such as removing a node from the cluster, may actually consist of several events. These actions may generate multiple log entries.

All log entries displayed in the admin console are also written to `syslog`.  You can configure `rsyslog` to monitor `syslog`. Enabled alerts are logged to `syslog` and appear with other log entries.

### Types of log entries

Log entries are categorized into events and alerts. Both types of entries appear in the logs, but alert log entries also include a boolean `"state"` parameter that indicates whether the alert is enabled or disabled.

Log entries include information about the specific event that occurred. See the log entry tables for [clusters]({{<relref "/rs/logging/rsyslog-logging/cluster-events">}}), [databases]({{<relref "/rs/logging/rsyslog-logging/bdb-events">}}), [nodes]({{<relref "/rs/logging/rsyslog-logging/node-events">}}), and [users]({{<relref "/rs/logging/rsyslog-logging/user-events">}}) for more details.

### Severity

You can also configure `rsyslog` to add other information, such as the event severity.

Since `rsyslog` entries do not include severity by default, you can follow these steps to enable it:

1. Add the following line to `/etc/rsyslog.conf`:
    ```
    $template TraditionalFormatWithPRI,"%pri-text%: %timegenerated% %HOSTNAME% %syslogtag%%msg:::drop-last-lf%\n"
    ```

2. Modify `$ActionFileDefaultTemplate` to use your new template `$ActionFileDefaultTemplateTraditionalFormatWithPRI`

3. Save these changes and restart `rsyslog` to apply them

You can see the log entries for alerts and events in the `/var/log/messages` file.

**Command components:**

- `%pri­text%` ­adds the severity
- `%timegenerated%` ­adds the timestamp
- `%HOSTNAME%` ­adds the machine name
- `%syslogtag%` adds ­the Redis Enterprise Software message. See the [log entry structure](#log-entry-structure) section for more details.
- `%msg:::drop­last­lf%n` ­removes duplicated log entries

## Log entry structure

The log entries have the following basic structure:

    event_log[<process id>]:{<list of key-value pairs in any order>}

- **event_log**:­ Plain static text is always shown at the beginning of the entry.
- **process id­**: The ID of the logging process
- **list of key-value pairs in any order**:­ A list of key-value pairs that describe the specific event. They can appear in any order. Some key­-value pairs are always shown, and some appear depending on the specific event.
    - **Key-­value pairs that always appear:**
        - `"type"`: A unique code­ name for the logged event. For the list of codenames, see the logged events and alerts tables for [clusters]({{<relref "/rs/logging/rsyslog-logging/cluster-events">}}), [databases]({{<relref "/rs/logging/rsyslog-logging/bdb-events">}}), [nodes]({{<relref "/rs/logging/rsyslog-logging/node-events">}}), and [users]({{<relref "/rs/logging/rsyslog-logging/user-events">}}).
        - `"object"`: Defines the object type and ID (if relevant) of the object this event relates to, such as cluster, node with ID, BDB with ID, etc. Has the format of <nobr>`<object type>[:<id>]`</nobr>. 
        - `"time"`: Unix epoch time but can be ignored in this context.
    - **Key-­value pairs that might appear depending on the specific entry:**
        - `"state"`: A boolean where `true` means the alert is enabled, and `false` means the alert is disabled. This is only relevant for alert log entries.
        - `"global_threshold"`: The value of a threshold for alerts related to cluster or node objects.
        - `"threshold"`: The value of a threshold for [alerts related to a BDB object]({{<relref "/rs/logging/rsyslog-logging/bdb-events">}}).

## Log entry samples

This section provides examples of log entries that include the [`rsyslog` configuration](#severity) to add the severity, timestamp, and machine name.

### Ephemeral storage passed threshold

#### "Alert on" log entry sample

```
daemon.warning: Jun 14 14:49:20 node1 event_log[3464]:
{
    "storage_util": 90.061643120001, 
    "global_threshold": "70", 
    "object": "node:1", 
    "state": true, 
    "time": 1434282560, 
    "type": "ephemeral_storage"
}
```

In this example, the storage utilization on node 1 reached the value of ~90%, which triggered the alert for "Ephemeral storage has reached 70% of its capacity."

**Log entry components:**

- `daemon.warning` -­ Severity of entry is `warning`
- `Jun 14 14:49:20` -­ The timestamp of the event
- `node1`:­ Machine name
- `event_log` -­ Static text that always appears
- `[3464]­` - Process ID
- `"storage_util":90.061643120001` - Current ephemeral storage utilization
- `"global_threshold":"70"` - The user-configured threshold above which the alert is raised
- `"object":"node:1"`­ - The object related to this alert
- `"state":true­` - Current state of the alert
- `"time":1434282560­` - Can be ignored
- `"type":"ephemeral_storage"` - The code name of this specific event. See [logged node alerts and events]({{<relref "/rs/logging/rsyslog-logging/node-events">}}) for more details.

#### "Alert off" log entry sample

```
daemon.info: Jun 14 14:51:35 node1 event_log[3464]: 
{
    "storage_util":60.051723520008, 
    "global_threshold": "70", 
    "object": "node:1", 
    "state":false, 
    "time": 1434283480, 
    "type": "ephemeral_storage"
}
```

This log entry is an example of when the alert for the node with ID 1 "Ephemeral storage has reached 70% of its capacity" has been turned off as result of storage utilization reaching the value of ~60%.

**Log entry components**:

- `daemon.info` -­ Severity of entry is `info`
- `Jun 14 14:51:35` -­ The timestamp of the event
- `node1` -­ Machine name

- `[3464]` -­ Process ID
- `"storage_util":60.051723520008­` - Current ephemeral storage utilization
- `"global_threshold":"70"` - The user configured threshold above which the alert is raised (70% in this case)
- `"object":"node:1"` -­ The object related to this alert
- `"state":false­` - Current state of the alert
- `"time":1434283480­` - Can be ignored
- `"type":"ephemeral_storage"` -­ The code name identifier of this specific event. See [logged node alerts and events]({{<relref "/rs/logging/rsyslog-logging/node-events">}}) for more details.
