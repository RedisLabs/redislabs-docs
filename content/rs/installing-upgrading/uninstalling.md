In the event that you need to uninstall Redis Enterprise Software
(RS) from a server, please run the following command in the operating
system CLI:

- In Ubuntu:

    ```src
    $ sudo apt-get purge redislabs
    ```

- In CentOS / RHEL:

    ```src
    $ sudo yum remove redislabs
    ```

After you confirm the uninstallation, the uninstall process runs and
removes the RS installation from the server.

Note: If you would like to uninstall RS, but keep the configuration and
persistence files intact, then you can use the apt-get remove command in
Ubuntu, or the rpm -e command in RHEL/CentOS/OEL. Note that you should
not try to reinstall RS on a node that still has the configuration files
on it as the installation might fail or end up corrupted.
