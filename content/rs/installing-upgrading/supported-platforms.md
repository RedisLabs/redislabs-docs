Redis Enterprise Software (RS) is supported on several operating systems, cloud environments, and virtual environments.

{{% note %}}
Make sure your system meets these requirements:

- Only 64-bit operating systems are supported.
- You must install Redis Enterprise Software directly on the host, not through system cloning.
- You must install on a clean host with no other applications running so that all RAM is allocated to the OS and RS only.
- Linux distributions must be installed with at least "Minimal Install" configuration.
