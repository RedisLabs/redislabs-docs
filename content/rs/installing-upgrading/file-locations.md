To make sure that Redis Enterprise Software functions properly, make sure that you handle the files in the application directories with care.

## Application directories

The directories that Redis Enterprise Software installs into are:

| **Path** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| /opt/redislabs | Main installation directory for all Redis Enterprise Software binaries |
| /opt/redislabs/bin | Binaries for all the utilities for command line access and managements such as "rladmin" or "redis-cli" |
| /opt/redislabs/config | System configuration files |
| /opt/redislabs/lib | System library files |
| /opt/redislabs/sbin | System binaries for tweaking provisioning |

## Configuration and data directories

The default directories that Redis Enterprise Software uses for data and metadata are:

| **Path** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| /var/opt/redislabs | Default storage location for the cluster data, system logs, backups and ephemeral, persisted data |
| /var/opt/redislabs/log | System logs for Redis Enterprise Software |
| /var/opt/redislabs/run | Socket files for Redis Enterprise Software |
| /etc/opt/redislabs | Default location for cluster manager configuration and certificates |
| /tmp | Temporary files |

You can change these file locations for:

- [Ephemeral and persistence storage]({{< relref "/rs/administering/cluster-operations/new-cluster-setup.md" >}}) during cluster setup
- [Socket files]({{< relref "/rs/installing-upgrading/configuring/change-location-socket-files.md" >}}) after cluster setup
