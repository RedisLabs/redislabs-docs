To establish a connection to a Redis database, you'll need the following information:

- The hostname or IP address of the Redis server
- The port number that the Redis server is listening at
- The database password (when configured with an authentication password which is **strongly recommended**)
- The SSL certificates (when configured with SSL authentication and encryption - see [this article](/kb/read-more-ssl) for more information)

The combination of `hostname:port` is commonly referred to as the "endpoint." This information is readily obtainable from your Redis Labs Enterprise Cluster and Redis Cloud web consoles. Unless otherwise specified, our Redis databases are accessible via a single managed endpoint to ensure high availability.

You can connect to a Redis database using a wide variety of tools and libraries depending on your needs. Here's a short list:

- Use one of the many [clients for Redis](redis.io/clients) - see below for client-specific information and examples
- Code your own Redis client based on the [Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP)](http://redis.io/topics/protocol)
- Make friends with Redis' own command line tool - `redis-cli` - to quickly connect and manage any Redis database (**tip:** you can also use `telnet` instead)
- Use tools that provide a [GUI for Redis](/blog/so-youre-looking-for-the-redis-gui)

## Basic connection troubleshooting

Connecting to a remote server can be challenging. Here’s a quick checklist for common pitfalls:

- Verify that the connection information was copy-pasted correctly <- more than 90% of connectivity issues are due to a single missing character.
- If you're using Redis in the cloud or not inside of a LAN, consider adjusting your client's timeout settings
- Try disabling any security measures that your database may have been set up with (e.g. Source IP/Subnet lists, Security Groups, SSL, etc...).
- Try using a command line tool to connect to the database from your server - it is possible that your host and/port are blocked by the network.
- If you've managed to open a connection, try sending the `INFO` command and act on its reply or error message.
- Redis Labs Redis databases only support connecting to the default database (0) and block some administrative commands. For more information, refer to the following:
