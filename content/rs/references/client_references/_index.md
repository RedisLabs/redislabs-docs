To connect to Redis instances from within your application, use a Redis client library that matches your application's language.

## Official clients

| Language | Client name |
|----------|-------------|
| .Net | [NRedisStack](https://redis.io/docs/clients/dotnet/) |
| Go | [go-redis](https://redis.io/docs/clients/go/) |
| Java | [Jedis](https://redis.io/docs/clients/java/) |
| Node.js | [node-redis](https://redis.io/docs/clients/nodejs/) |
| Python | [redis-py](https://redis.io/docs/clients/python/) |

Select a client name to see its quick start.
