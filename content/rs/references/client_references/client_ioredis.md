In order to use Redis with Node.js, you need to install a Node.js Redis client.
In the following sections, we demonstrate the use of [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis),
a community recommended Redis client for Node.js with support for Promises built in.
The other community recommended client for Node.js developers is [node_redis]({{< relref "./client_nodejs" >}}).

Additional Node.js clients for Redis can be found under the [Node.js section](https://redis.io/clients#Node.js) of the [Redis Clients page](https://redis.io/clients).

## Installing ioredis

Complete instructions for installing ioredis can be found in the [README file](https://github.com/luin/ioredis/blob/master/README.md).
To install ioredis, run:

    npm install ioredis 

## Connecting to Redis

This example code creates a connection to Redis:

    ```javascript
        const Redis = require('ioredis');
        const redis = new Redis({
            host: 'hostname',
            port: 6379,
            password: 'password'
        });
    ```

Make sure to replace the values in the example with the values for your Redis instance:

- `'hostname'` - The name of the host your database runs on
- `6379` - The port that Redis listens on (Default: 6379)
- `'password'` - The default Redis password, if configured

    Remember to always store passwords outside of your code, for example in environment variables.

## Connecting to Redis with TLS

This example shows how to configure ioredis to make a connection to Redis using TLS:

    ```javascript
    const Redis = require('ioredis');
    const fs = require('fs');

    const redis = new Redis({
        host: 'hostname',
        port: 6379,
        tls: {
            key: fs.readFileSync('path_to_keyfile', encoding='ascii'),
            cert: fs.readFileSync('path_to_certfile', encoding='ascii'),
            ca: [ fs.readFileSync('path_to_ca_certfile', encoding='ascii') ]
        }
    });
    ```

## Connecting to Redis using an ACL user and password

Redis 6 introduced [Access Control Lists](https://redis.io/topics/acl).
ACLs provide the capability to create named user accounts, each having its own password.

To connect to Redis as an ACL user, provide the user's username and password when creating the client:

    ```javascript
    const Redis = require('ioredis');
    const redis = new Redis({
        host: 'hostname',
        port: 6379,
        username: 'username',
        password: 'password'
    });
    ```

Make sure to replace the values in the example with the values for your Redis instance:

- `'hostname'` - The name of the host your database runs on
- `6379` - The port that Redis listens on (Default: 6379)
- `'username'` - The username of the ACL user
- `'password'` - The password of the ACL user

{{< note >}}
ioredis uses the Redis `INFO` command while creating a new connection.
Your ACL user must have permission to run that command, otherwise connection attempts will fail with a `NOPERM` error message:

    ```sh
    [ioredis] Unhandled error event: ReplyError: 
    NOPERM this user has no permissions to run the 'info' command or its 
    subcommand
    ```

## Reading and writing data with ioredis

After the connection to Redis is established, you can start reading and writing data.
The following code snippet reads the value stored at the key `foo`, and prints it:

    ```javascript
    // Open a connection to Redis
    // 'foo' has been set to 'bar'.
    ...
 
    client.get('foo', (err, reply) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(reply);
    });
    ```

The output of the above code is:

    ```sh
    $ node example_ioredis.js
    bar
    ```

ioredis exposes a function named for each Redis command.
The first argument is almost always the Redis key to run the command against.
These arguments are followed by an optional error first callback function.
If a callback function is not provided, a Promise is returned:

    ```javascript
    // Open a connection to Redis
    // 'foo' has been set to 'bar'.

    const redisDemo = async () => {
        const reply = await redis.get('foo');
        console.log(reply);
    };

    redisDemo();
    ```

The output of the above code should be:

    ```sh
    $ node example_ioredis.js
    bar
    ```
