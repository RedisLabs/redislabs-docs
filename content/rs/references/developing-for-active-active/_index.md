Developing geo-distributed, multi-master applications can be difficult.
Application developers may have to understand a large number of race
conditions between updates to various sites, network, and cluster
failures that could reorder the events and change the outcome of the
updates performed across geo-distributed writes.

Active-Active databases (formerly known as CRDB) are geo-distributed databases that span multiple Redis Enterprise Software (RS) clusters.
Active-Active databases depend on multi-master replication (MMR) and Conflict-free
Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to power a simple development experience
for geo-distributed applications. Active-Active databases allow developers to use existing
Redis data types and commands, but understand the developers intent and
automatically handle conflicting concurrent writes to the same key
across multiple geographies. For example, developers can simply use the
INCR or INCRBY method in Redis in all instances of the geo-distributed
application, and Active-Active databases handle the additive nature of INCR to reflect the
correct final value. The following example displays a sequence of events
over time : t1 to t9. This Active-Active database has two member Active-Active databases : member CRDB1 and
member CRDB2. The local operations executing in each member Active-Active database is
listed under the member Active-Active database name. The "Sync" even represent the moment
where synchronization catches up to distribute all local member Active-Active database
updates to other participating clusters and other member Active-Active databases.

|  **Time** | **Member CRDB1** | **Member CRDB2** |
|  :------: | :------: | :------: |
|  t1 | INCRBY key1 7 |  |
|  t2 |  | INCRBY key1 3 |
|  t3 | GET key1<br/>7 | GET key1<br/>3 |
|  t4 | — Sync — | — Sync — |
|  t5 | GET key1<br/>10 | GET key1<br/>10 |
|  t6 | DECRBY key1 3 |  |
|  t7 |  | INCRBY key1 6 |
|  t8 | — Sync — | — Sync — |
|  t9 | GET key1<br/>13 | GET key1<br/>13 |

Databases provide various approaches to address some of these concerns:

- Active-Passive Geo-distributed deployments: With active-passive
    distributions, all writes go to an active cluster. Redis Enterprise
    provides a "Replica Of" capability that provides a similar approach.
    This can be employed when the workload is heavily balanced towards
    read and few writes. However, WAN performance and availability
    is quite flaky and traveling large distances for writes take away
    from application performance and availability.
- Two-phase Commit (2PC): This approach is designed around a protocol
    that commits a transaction across multiple transaction managers.
    Two-phase commit provides a consistent transactional write across
    regions but fails transactions unless all participating transaction
    managers are "available" at the time of the transaction. The number
    of messages exchanged and its cross-regional availability
    requirement make two-phase commit unsuitable for even moderate
    throughputs and cross-geo writes that go over WANs.
- Sync update with Quorum-based writes: This approach synchronously
    coordinates a write across majority number of replicas across
    clusters spanning multiple regions. However, just like two-phase
    commit, number of messages exchanged and its cross-regional
    availability requirement make geo-distributed quorum writes
    unsuitable for moderate throughputs and cross geo writes that go
    over WANs.
- Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) Conflict Resolution: Some systems provide
    simplistic conflict resolution for all types of writes where the
    system clocks are used to determine the winner across conflicting
    writes. LWW is lightweight and can be suitable for simpler data.
    However, LWW can be destructive to updates that are not necessarily
    conflicting. For example adding a new element to a set across two
    geographies concurrently would result in only one of these new
    elements appearing in the final result with LWW.
- MVCC (multi-version concurrency control): MVCC systems maintain
    multiple versions of data and may expose ways for applications to
    resolve conflicts. Even though MVCC system can provide a flexible
    way to resolve conflicting writes, it comes at a cost of great
    complexity in the development of a solution.

Even though types and commands in Active-Active databases look identical to standard Redis
types and commands, the underlying types in RS are enhanced to maintain
more metadata to create the conflict-free data type experience. This
section explains what you need to know about developing with Active-Active databases on
Redis Enterprise Software.

## Compatibility

Active-Active databases behave like standard Redis databases, except for a few
differences:

- Active-Active databases in this version support all major Redis data types. See the
    list of types supported in Active-Active databases under the Data Types
    section.
- As conflict handling rules differ between data types, some commands
    have slightly different requirements in Active-Active databases vs standard Redis
    databases. (ex: String type)

## Data types

Even though the data types and methods look identical in standard Redis
and Active-Active databases, there are specific rules that govern the handling of
conflicting concurrent writes to each type.

From a developer's perspective, most supported data types work the same
as standard Redis. However, a few methods also come with specific
requirements in Active-Active databases.

Below is a table of the primary data types and their support levels,
followed by descriptions:

| **Data Type** | **Support Level** |
|------------|-----------------|
| Bitfield | [Supported]({{< relref "/rs/references/developing-for-active-active/developing-strings-active-active.md" >}}) |
| Float Counters | [Supported]({{< relref "/rs/references/developing-for-active-active/developing-strings-active-active.md#string-counter-support" >}}) |
| Geospatial | [Supported]({{< relref "/rs/references/developing-for-active-active/developing-sorted-sets-active-active.md" >}}) |
| Hashes | [Supported]({{< relref "/rs/references/developing-for-active-active/developing-hashes-active-active.md" >}}); Hash fields are treated as strings or counters |
| Integer Counters | [Supported]({{< relref "/rs/references/developing-for-active-active/developing-strings-active-active.md#string-counter-support" >}}) |
| Lists | [Supported]({{< relref "/rs/references/developing-for-active-active/developing-lists-active-active.md" >}}) |
| Sets | [Supported]({{< relref "/rs/references/developing-for-active-active/developing-sets-active-active.md" >}}) |
| Strings | [Supported]({{< relref "/rs/references/developing-for-active-active/developing-strings-active-active.md" >}}) |
| Sorted Sets | [Supported]({{< relref "/rs/references/developing-for-active-active/developing-sorted-sets-active-active.md" >}}) |
| HyperLogLog | [Supported]({{< relref "/rs/references/developing-for-active-active/developing-hll-active-active.md" >}}) |
| Streams | [Supported]({{< relref "/rs/references/developing-for-active-active/developing-strings-active-active.md" >}}) |
| Bitsets | Not currently supported |

### Other data types

Bitmap and Bitfields, data types and operations are
not currently supported in this version of
Active-Active databases.

## Lua scripts

Active-Active databases support Lua scripts, but unlike standard Redis, Lua scripts always
execute in effects replication mode. There is currently no way to
execute them in script-replication mode.

## Eviction

Active-Active databases always operate in no eviction mode. The reasoning is that if
memory is low, eviction may not help (or even worse) until garbage
collection takes place.

## Expiration

Expiration is supported with special multi-master semantics.

If a key's expiration time is changed at the same time on different
members of the Active-Active database, the longer extended time set via TTL on a key is
preserved. As an example:

If this command was performed on key1 on cluster #1

```sh
127.0.0.1:6379> EXPIRE key1 10
```

And if this command was performed on key1 on cluster #2

```sh
127.0.0.1:6379> EXPIRE key1 50
```

The EXPIRE command setting the key to 50 would win.

And if this command was performed on key1 on cluster #3:

```sh
127.0.0.1:6379> PERSIST key1
```

It would win out of the three clusters hosting the Active-Active database as it sets the
TTL on key1 to an infinite time.

The replica responsible for the "winning" expire value is also
responsible to expire the key and propagate a DEL effect when this
happens. A "losing" replica is from this point on not responsible
for expiring the key, unless another EXPIRE command resets the TTL.
Furthermore, a replica that is NOT the "owner" of the expired value:

- Silently ignores the key if a user attempts to access it in READ
    mode, e.g. treating it as if it was expired but not propagating a
    DEL.
- Expires it (sending a DEL) before making any modifications if a user
    attempts to access it in WRITE mode.

## Out-of-Memory (OOM) {#outofmemory-oom}

If a member Active-Active database is in an out of memory situation, that member is marked
"inconsistent" by RS, the member stops responding to user traffic, and
the syncer initiates full reconciliation with other peers in the Active-Active database.

## Active-Active Database Key Counts

Keys are counted differently for Active-Active databases:

- DBSIZE (in `shard-cli dbsize`) reports key header instances
    that represent multiple potential values of a key before a replication conflict is resolved.
- expired_keys (in `bdb-cli info`) can be more than the keys count in DBSIZE (in `shard-cli dbsize`) 
    because expires are not always removed when a key becomes a tombstone.
    A tombstone is a key that is logically deleted but still takes memory
    until it is collected by the garbage collector.
- The Expires average TTL (in `bdb-cli info`) is computed for local expires only.

## INFO
