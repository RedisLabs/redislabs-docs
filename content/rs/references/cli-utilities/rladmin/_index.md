`rladmin` is a command-line utility that lets you perform administrative tasks such as failover, migration, and endpoint binding on a Redis Enterprise Software cluster. You can also use `rladmin` to edit cluster and database configurations. 

Although you can use the admin console for some of these tasks, others are unique to the `rladmin` command-line tool.

## Use the `rladmin` shell

To open the `rladmin` shell:

1. Sign in to a Redis Enterprise Software node with an account that is a member of the **redislabs** group.

    The `rladmin` binary is located in `/opt/redislabs/bin`. If you don't have this directory in your `PATH`, you may want to add it. Otherwise, you can use `bash -l <username>` to sign in as a user with permissions for that directory.

1. Run: `rladmin`

    {{<note>}}
If the CLI does not recognize the `rladmin` command,
run this command to load the necessary configuration first: <nobr>`bash -l`</nobr>
    {{</note>}}

In the `rladmin` shell, you can:

- Run any `rladmin` command without prefacing it with `rladmin`.
- Enter `?` to view the full list of available commands.
- Enter [`help`]({{<relref "/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/help">}}) followed by the name of a command for a detailed explanation of the command and its usage.
- Press the `Tab` key for command completion.
- Enter `exit` or press `Control+D` to exit the `rladmin` shell and return to the terminal prompt.
