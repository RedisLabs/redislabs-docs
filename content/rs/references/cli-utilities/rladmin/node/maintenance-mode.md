Configures [quorum-only mode]({{<relref "/rs/clusters/maintenance-mode#activate-maintenance-mode">}}) on a node.

## `node maintenance_mode on`

Migrates shards out of the node and turns the node into a quorum node to prevent shards from returning to it.

```sh
rladmin node <ID> maintenance_mode on
        [ keep_slave_shards ]
        [ evict_ha_replica { enabled | disabled } ]
        [ evict_active_active_replica { enabled | disabled } ]
        [ evict_dbs <database_id1> [<database_id2> ... <database_idN>] ]
        [ demote_node ]
        [ overwrite_snapshot ]
        [ max_concurrent_actions <integer> ]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter             | Type/Value                     | Description                                                                               |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| node                  | integer                        | Turns the specified node into a quorum node                                              |
| demote_node           |                                | If the node is a primary node, changes the node to replica                                |
| evict_ha_replica | `enabled`<br />`disabled` | Migrates the HA replica shards in the node |
| evict_active_active_replica | `enabled`<br />`disabled` | Migrates the Active-Active replica shards in the node |
| evict_dbs | list of database IDs | Specify databases whose shards should be evicted from the node when entering maintenance mode. This is in addition to the enslaving of all master shards on the node. This list marks databases to evict even if other flags state differently. |
| keep_slave_shards     |                                | Keeps replica shards in the node and demotes primary shards to replicas.<br /><br />Deprecated as of Redis Enterprise Software 7.4.2. Use `evict_ha_replica disabled evict_active_active_replica disabled` instead. |
| max_concurrent_actions | integer | Maximum number of concurrent actions during node maintenance |
| overwrite_snapshot | | Overwrites the latest existing node snapshot taken when enabling maintenance mode |

### Returns

Returns `OK` if the node was converted successfully. If the cluster does not have enough resources to migrate the shards, the process returns a warning.

Use [`rladmin status nodes`]({{<relref "/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/status#status-nodes">}}) to verify the node became a quorum node.

### Example

```sh
$ rladmin node 2 maintenance_mode on overwrite_snapshot
Found snapshot from 2024-01-06T11:36:47Z, overwriting the snapshot
Performing maintenance_on action on node:2: 0%
created snapshot NodeSnapshot<name=maintenance_mode_2024-01-11_20-25-37,time=None,node_uid=2>

node:2 will not accept any more shards
Performing maintenance_on action on node:2: 100%
OK
$ rladmin status nodes

```

## `node maintenance_mode off`

Turns maintenance mode off and returns the node to its previous state.

```sh
rladmin node <ID> maintenance_mode off
        [ { snapshot_name <name> | skip_shards_restore } ]
        [ max_concurrent_actions <integer> ]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter             | Type/Value                     | Description                                                                               |

| node                  | integer                        | Restores the node back to the previous state                                              |
| max_concurrent_actions | integer | Maximum number of concurrent actions during node maintenance |
| skip_shards_restore   |                                | Does not restore shards back to the node                                                  |
| snapshot_name         | string                         | Restores the node back to a state stored in the specified snapshot                        |

### Returns

Returns `OK` if the node was restored successfully.

Use [`rladmin status nodes`]({{<relref "/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/status#status-nodes">}}) to verify the node was restored.
