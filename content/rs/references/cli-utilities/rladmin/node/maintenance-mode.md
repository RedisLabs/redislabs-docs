Configures [quorum-only mode]({{<relref "/rs/concepts/high-availability/rack-zone-awareness#node-layout">}}) on a node.

## `node maintenance_mode on`

Migrates shards out of the node and turns the node into a quorum node to prevent shards from returning to it.

```sh
rladmin node <ID> maintenance_mode on
                [keep_slave_shards]
                [demote_node]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter             | Type/Value                     | Description                                                                               |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| node                  | integer                        | Turns the specified node into a quorum node                                              |
| demote_node           |                                | If the node is a primary node, changes the node to replica                                |
| keep_slave_shards     |                                | Keeps replica shards in the node and demotes primary shards to replicas                    |

### Returns

Returns `OK` if the node was converted successfully. If the cluster does not have enough resources to migrate the shards, the process returns a warning.

Use [`rladmin status nodes`]({{<relref "/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/status#status-nodes">}}) to verify the node became a quorum node.

### Example

```sh
$ rladmin node 2 maintenance_mode on
Performing maintenance_on action on node:2: 0%
created snapshot NodeSnapshot<name=maintenance_mode_2022-05-12_20-25-37,time=None,node_uid=2>

node:2 will not accept any more shards
Performing maintenance_on action on node:2: 100%
OK
$ rladmin status nodes

```

## `node maintenance_mode off`

Turns maintenance mode off and returns the node to its previous state.

```sh
rladmin node <ID> maintenance_mode off
                [ { snapshot_name <name> | skip_shards_restore } ]
```

### Parameters

| node                  | integer                        | Restores the node back to the previous state                                              |
| snapshot_name         | string                         | Restores the node back to a state stored in the specified snapshot                        |
| skip_shards_restore   |                                | Does not restore shards back to the node                                                  |

### Returns

Returns `OK` if the node was restored successfully.

Use [`rladmin status nodes`]({{<relref "/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/status#status-nodes">}}) to verify the node was restored.
