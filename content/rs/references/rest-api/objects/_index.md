This page serves as the entry page for the Object reference section of the RS REST API docs.

When finished, it will contain:

- General information that applies to objects using by the REST API, where request objects or response objects.

- An allchildren macro that displays a list of available object reference pages.

Pages will be adapted from the HTML shipped in the REST API tarball provided with RS 6.2.4.
