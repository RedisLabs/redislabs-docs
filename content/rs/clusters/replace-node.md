If a node in your Redis Enterprise Software cluster is faulty, its status appears as **Down** in
the **Status** column of the **Nodes** page, and in the **Cluster \>
Configuration** page.

![Example of a node
failure](/images/rs/node-failure.png)

**To replace a faulty node**:

1. Acquire a new node that is identical to the old node, install and
    configure Redis Enterprise Software on it per the [install
    instructions]({{< relref "/rs/installing-upgrading/_index.md" >}}).

    {{< note >}}
If you are using [Auto Tiering]({{< relref "/rs/databases/auto-tiering/" >}}),
you must make sure the required flash storage is set up on this new node.

1. Add a new node, as described in [adding a new node to a
    cluster]({{< relref "/rs/clusters/add-node.md" >}}).
1. Make sure the new node has as much available memory as the faulty
    node.
1. A message appears, informing you that the cluster has a faulty node
    and that the new node replaces the faulty node.
1. If the new node has insufficient memory, you are prompted to add a
    different node - one with sufficient memory.

    {{< note >}}
- If there is a faulty node in the cluster to which you are adding a node,
- RS enforces using the new node to replace the faulty one.
- If you are using the DNS NS record based connection approach,
the [DNS records must be updated]({{< relref "/rs/networking/cluster-dns/_index.md" >}})
each time a node is added or replaced.
