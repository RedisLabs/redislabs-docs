In this quick setup guide, we take you through the steps to install RS in a Linux environment to test its capabilities.

- To run RS in a Docker container on Linux, Windows, or MacOS, go to the
  [Docker Quick Start Guide]({{< relref "/rs/getting-started/docker/getting-started-docker.md" >}}).
- To install RS on Linux in a production environment, follow the complete instuctions 
  in [installing RS] ({{< relref "/rs/installing-upgrading/downloading-installing.md" >}}).

The steps to set up a Redis Enterprise Software (RS) cluster with a
single node are super simple and go as follows:

- Step 1: Install Redis Enterprise Software
- Step 2: Setup a Redis Enterprise Software cluster
- Step 3: Create a new Redis database
- Step 4: Connect to your Redis database

## Step 1: Install Redis Enterprise Software

You can download the binaries from the [Redis Enterprise Software
download
site](https://app.redislabs.com/#/sign-up/software?direct=true) and copy the download package to machine with a Linux-based OS. To untar the image:

```src
$ tar vxf <downloaded tar file name>
```

Once the tar command completes, install RS with the install.sh script in
the current directory.

```src
$ sudo ./install.sh -y
```

{{% note %}}When port 53 is in use, the installation fails. This is known to happen in 
default Ubuntu 18.04 installations in which systemd-resolved (DNS server) is running.
To workaround this issue, change the system configuration to make this port available
before running RS installation.

{{% expand "Example steps to resolve the port 53 conflict:" %}}

1. Run: `sudo gedit /etc/systemd/resolved.conf`
1. Add `DNSStubListener=no` as the last line in the file and save the file.
1. Run: `sudo mv /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.orig`
1. Run: `sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf`
1. Run: `sudo service systemd-resolved restart`

## Step 2: Setup a Cluster

1. In the web browser on the host machine, go to https://localhost:8443 to see
the Redis Enterprise Software web console.

    Note:

    - Depending on your browser, you may see a certificate error. You can safely 
    continue to the web console.
    - If you see an error from nginx, try again after a few minutes.

1. Click **Setup** to start the node configuration steps.

1. In the **Node Configuration** settings, enter a cluster FQDN such as `cluster.local`. 
Then click **Next** button.

    ![Redis Enterprise Software node configuration](/images/rs/getstarted-nodeconfig.png?width=600)

1. Enter your license key, if you have one. If not, click the **Next** button to use the trial version.

1. Enter an email and password for the admin account for the web console.

    ![Redis Enterprise Software admin credentials](/images/rs/getstarted-admincredentials.png?width=600)

1. Click **OK** to confirm that you are aware of the replacement of the HTTPS SSL 
certificate on the node, and proceed through the browser warning.

## Step 3: Create a Database

1. Select "redis database" and the "single region" deployment, and click Next.

    ![Redis Enterprise Software create database](/images/rs/getstarted-newdatabase.png)

1. Enter a database name such as `database1` and click **Activate** to create your database.

    ![Redis Enterprise Software configure new database
screen](/images/rs/getstarted-createdatabase.png)

You now have a Redis database!

## Step 4: Connect to your Database

After you create the Redis database, you are ready to store data in your
database. You can test connectivity to your database with:

- redis-cli - the built-in command-line tool
- A _Hello World_ application using Python

### Connecting Using redis-cli

redis-cli is a simple command-line tool to interact with Redis database.

Run redis-cli, located in the /opt/redislabs/bin directory, to connect
to port 12000 and store and retrieve a key in database1

```src
$ sudo /opt/redislabs/bin/redis-cli -p 12000
127.0.0.1:16653> set key1 123
OK
127.0.0.1:16653> get key1
"123"
```

### Connecting Using _Hello World_ Application in Python

A simple python application running on the **host machine**, not the
container, can also connect to database1.

Note: The following section assumes you already have Python and redis-py
(python library for connecting to Redis) configured on the host machine
running the container. You can find the instructions to configure
redis-py on the [github page for
redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py).

1. Create a new file called `redis_test.py` with this contents:

    ```python
    import redis

    r = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=12000, db=0)
    print ("set key1 123")
    print (r.set('key1', '123'))
    print ("get key1")
    print(r.get('key1'))
    ```

1. Run the redis_test.py application to store and retrieve a key:

    ```src
    python.exe redis_test.py
    ```

If the connection is successful, the output of the application looks like this:

```src
set key1 123
True
get key1
b'123'
```

## Next steps

Now you have a Redis Enterprise cluster ready to go. You can connect to it with 
a [redis client](https://redis.io/clients) to start loading it with data or 
you can use the [memtier_benchmark Quick Start]({{< relref "/rs/getting-started/memtier-benchmark.md" >}})
to check the cluster performance.
