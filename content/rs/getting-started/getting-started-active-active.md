In this guide, we'll set up an Active-Active database, formerly known as CRDB (Conflict-free
Replicated DataBase) spanning across two Redis Enterprise Software
clusters for test and development environments. Here are the steps:

- Step 1: Run two Redis Enterprise Software (RS) Docker containers
- Step 2: Set up each container as a cluster
- Step 3: Create a new Redis Enterprise Active-Active database
- Step 4: Test connectivity to the Active-Active database

To run an Active-Active database on installations from the [RS download package]({{< relref "/rs/getting-started/_index.md" >}}),
set up two RS installations and continue from Step 2.

{{< note >}}
This getting started guide is for development or demonstration environments.
To set up an Active-Active database in a production environment, use the instructions for
[creating an Active-Active database]({{< relref "/rs/administering/creating-databases/create-active-active.md" >}}).
{{< /note >}}

## Step 1: Run two containers

To spin up two RS containers, run these commands:

```sh
docker run -d --cap-add sys_resource -h rp1_node1 --name rp1_node1 -p 8443:8443 -p 9443:9443 -p 12000:12000 redislabs/redis
```

```sh
docker run -d --cap-add sys_resource -h rp2_node1 --name rp2_node1 -p 8445:8443 -p 9445:9443 -p 12002:12000 redislabs/redis
```

The **-p** options map the web UI port (8443), REST API port (9443), and
database access port differently for each container to make sure that all
containers can be accessed from the host OS that is running the containers.

## Step 2: Setup two clusters

1. For cluster 1, direct your browser to **https://localhost:8443** on the
host machine to see the Redis Enterprise Software web console. Simply
click the **Setup** button on the page to get started.

    Note: Depending on your browser, you may see a certificate error. Continue to
    the website.

    ![rs-setup](/images/rs/rs-setup.png)

1. On the **node configuration** page, select your default settings and
provide a cluster FQDN, for example `cluster1.local`. Then click
**Next** button.

    ![node-config](/images/rs/node-config.png)

1. If you don't have a license key, click the **Next** button to try the
trial version of the product.

1. On the next screen, set up a Cluster Administrator account using an
email for the login and a password.

    ![set-admin-credentials](/images/rs/set-admin-credentials.png)

1. Click **OK** to confirm that you are aware of the replacement of the HTTPS SSL/TLS
    certificate on the node, and proceed through the browser warning.

Repeat the same operations for cluster 2 with these differences:

- In your web browser, go to **https://localhost:8445** to
    set up the cluster 2.
- For the **Cluster name (FQDN)**, enter a different name, such as `cluster2.local`.

Now we have two Redis Enterprise Software clusters with FQDNs
**cluster1.local** and **cluster2.local**.

## Step 3: Create a Redis Active-Active database

1. After you login to cluster1.local, select the Redis database and deployment type
**Geo-Distributed**. Then click **Next**.

    ![new_geo-distrbuted](/images/rs/new_geo-distrbuted.png?width=600&height=608)

1. In **create database**, click the **show advanced option** and:

    1. For the **database name**, enter: `database1`
    1. For the **endpoint port number**, enter: `12000`
    1. In the **participating clusters** list, add the address and admin credentials for:
        - `https://cluster1.local:9443` - the cluster you are currently connected to
        - `https://cluster2.local:9443` - the other cluster
    <!-- Also in create-crdb.md -->
    1. In the **Database clustering** option, either:

        - Make sure the Database clustering is enabled and select the number of shards
        that you want to have in the database. When database clustering is enabled,
        databases are subject to limitations on [Multi-key commands]({{< relref "/rs/concepts/high-availability/clustering.md" >}}).
        You can increase the number of shards in the database at any time.
        - Clear the **Database clustering** option to use only one shard and so
        that the [Multi-key commands]({{< relref "/rs/concepts/high-availability/clustering.md" >}})
        limitations do not apply.

        Note: You cannot enable or disable database clustering after the Active-Active database is created.

1. Click **Activate** to create your Active-Active database.

    ![crdb-activate](/images/rs/crdb-activate.png)

    <!-- Also in getting-started-docker.md -->
    Note: If you cannot activate the database because of a memory limitation,
    make sure that Docker has enough memory allocated in the Advanced section
    of Docker Settings.

1. After the Active-Active database is created, you can now visit each cluster 1 at
https://localhost:8443 and cluster 2 at https://localhost:8445.

1. Make sure that each cluster has an Active-Active database member database with the name `database1`.

    In a real-world deployment, cluster 1 and cluster 2 would most likely be
    in separate data centers in different regions. However, for
    local testing we created the scale-minimized deployment using two
    local clusters running on the same host.

<!-- Also in getting-started-crdbs.md -->
## Step 4: Test the connection to your member Redis Active-Active databases

With the Redis database created, you are ready to connect to your
database to store data. You can use one of the following ways to test
connectivity to your database:

- Connect with redis-cli, the built-in command-line tool
- Connect with a _Hello World_ application written in Python

Remember we have two member Active-Active databases that are available for connections and
concurrent reads and writes. The member Active-Active databases are using bi-directional
replication to for the global Active-Active database.

### Connecting using redis-cli {#connecting-using-rediscli}

redis-cli is a simple command-line tool to interact with redis database.

1. To switch your context into the RS container of node 1 in cluster 1, run:

    ```sh
    docker exec -it rp1_node1 bash
    ```

1. To use redis-cli on port 12000, run:

    ```sh
    redis-cli -p 12000
    ```

1. Store and retrieve a key in the database to test the connection with these
    commands:

    - `set key1 123`
    - `get key1`

    The output of the command looks like this:

    ```sh
    127.0.0.1:12000> set key1 123
    OK
    127.0.0.1:12000> get key1
    "123"
    ```

1. Enter `exit` to exit the redis-cli context and enter `exit` again to exit the
   RS container of node 1 in cluster 1.
1. To see that the key replicated to cluster 2, repeat the steps to switch your
   context into the RS container of node 1 in cluster 2, run the redis-cli and
   retrieve key1.

    The output of the commands looks like this:

    ```sh
    $ docker exec -it rp2_node1 bash
    $ redis-cli -p 12000
    127.0.0.1:12000> get key1
    "123"
    ```

### Connecting using _Hello World_ application in Python

A simple python application running on the host machine can also connect
to the database.

Note: Before you continue, you must have python and
[redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py#installation)
(python library for connecting to Redis) configured on the host machine
running the container.

1. In the command-line terminal, create a new file called "redis_test.py"

    ```sh
    vi redis_test.py
    ```

1. Paste this code into the "redis_test.py" file.

    This application stores a value in key1 in cluster 1, gets that value from
    key1 in cluster 1, and gets the value from key1 in cluster 2.

    ```py
    import redis

    rp1 = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=12000, db=0)
    rp2 = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=12002, db=0)

    print ("set key1 123 in cluster 1")
    print (rp1.set('key1', '123'))
    print ("get key1 cluster 1")
    print (rp1.get('key1'))

    print ("get key1 from cluster 2")
    print (rp2.get('key1'))
    ```

1. To run the "redis_test.py" application, run:

    ```sh
    python redis_test.py
    ```

    If the connection is successful, the output of the application looks like:

    ```sh
    set key1 123 in cluster 1
    True
    get key1 cluster 1
    "123"
    get key1 from cluster 2
    "123"
    ```
