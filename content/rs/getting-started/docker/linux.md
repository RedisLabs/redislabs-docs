To get started with a single Redis Enterprise Software container on
Linux, follow these four steps:

- Step 1: Run the container
- Step 2: Set up a cluster
- Step 3: Create a new database
- Step 4: Connect to your database

You can also visit [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/redislabs/redis/) for instructions on
getting Docker installed and working with the Redis Enterprise Software
Docker container image.

## Step-by-Step Guide for Redis Enterprise Software on Linux

### Step 1: Run the Container

Run the Redis Enterprise Software Docker container by executing the
following command in the Terminal window.

```src
$ docker run -d --cap-add sys_resource --name rp \
-p 8443:8443 -p 12000:12000 redislabs/redis
```

### Step 2: Set up a Cluster

Direct your browser to https://localhost:8443/ on the host machine to
see the Redis Enterprise Software web console. Simply click "Setup"
button on the page to get started.

Note: Depending on your browser, you may see a certificate error. Simply
choose "continue to the website" to get to the setup screen.

On the "node configuration" page, select your default settings and
provide a cluster FQDN: "cluster.local". Then simply click the "Next"
button.

If you don't have a license key, click the "Next" button to try the
trial version of the product.

On the next screen, set up a Cluster Administrator account using
an email for login and a password.

### Step 3: Create a Database

Choose the "new redis db" option.

On the "new redis db" page, click the "show advanced option" link and
enter "database1" for a database name and "12000" for the endpoint port
number. Then click "Activate" to create your database.

You now have a Redis database!

### Step 4: Connect to your Database

With a Redis database created, you are ready to connect to your database
and store data. You can use one of the following ways to test
connectivity to your database:

- Connecting with redis-cli, the built-in command line tool
- Connecting with a _Hello World_ application using Python.

### Connecting Using redis-cli

redis-cli is a simple command line tool to interact with redis database.

Use "docker exec" to switch your context into the Redis Enterprise
Software container

```src
$ docker exec -it rp bash
```

Run redis-cli, located in the /opt/redislabs/bin directory, to connect
to port 12000 and store and retrieve a key in database1

```src
$ sudo /opt/redislabs/bin/redis-cli -p 12000
127.0.0.1:16653> set key1 123
OK
127.0.0.1:16653> get key1
"123"
```

### Connecting Using _Hello World_ Application in Python

A simple python application running on the **host machine**, not the
container, can also connect to database1.

Note: The following section assumes you already have Python and redis-py
(Python library for connecting to redis) configured on the host machine
running the container. You can find the instructions to configure
redis-py on the [github page for
redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py).

In the command line Terminal, create a new file called "redis_test.py"

```src
$ vi redis_test.py
```

Paste the following into a file named "redis_test.py".

```src
import redis

r = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=12000, db=0)
print ("set key1 123")
print (r.set('key1', '123'))
print ("get key1")
print(r.get('key1'))
```

Run "redis_test.py" application to connect to the database and store
and retrieve a key using the command line:

```src
$ python redis_test.py
```

The output should look like the following screen if the connection is
successful:

```src
set key1 123
True
get key1
b'123'
```
