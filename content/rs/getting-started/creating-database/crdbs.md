In this guide, we'll set up a scale-minimized CRDB (conflict-free
replicated database) spanning across two Redis Enterprise Software
clusters for test and development environments. Here are the steps:

- Step 1: Run four Docker containers
- Step 2: Setup two clusters
- Step 3: Create a new Redis Enterprise CRDB
- Step 4: Connect to your member Redis Enterprise CRDBs

The steps do the installation through Docker containers. However bare
metal installation is quite similar to installing and setting up
clusters on other infrastructure like bare metal machines or virtualized
environments on Windows, MacOS or Linux. You can find other "Getting
Started" guides [here]({{< relref "/rs/getting-started/quick-setup.md" >}}).

Note: if you are setting up a production-grade environment, please
follow the detailed installation guide in the administration section.

## Step 1: Run Two Containers

We'll use two of the containers for first cluster and the remaining two
containers for the second cluster.

```src
$ docker run -d --cap-add sys_resource -h rp1_node1 --name rp1_node1 
-p 8443:8443 -p 9443:9443 -p 12000:12000 redislabs/redis

$ docker run -d --cap-add sys_resource -h rp2_node1 --name rp2_node1 
-p 8445:8443 -p 9445:9443 -p 12002:12000 redislabs/redis
```

It is important to note the **-p** options: Each container maps its web
UI port (8443), REST API port (9443), and database access port to a
unique number to ensure all containers can be accessed from the host OS
that's running the containers.

Note: You may have to increase the amount of RAM allocated to Docker on
your computer. This setting is under Preferences -\> Advanced.

## Step 2: Setup Two Clusters

For cluster 1, direct your browser to **https://localhost:8443** on the
host machine to see the Redis Enterprise Software web console. Simply
click the **Setup** button on the page to get started.

Note: Depending on your browser, you may see a certificate error. Simply
choose **continue to the website** to get to the setup screen.

On the **node configuration** page, select your default settings and
provide a cluster FQDN: **cluster1.local**. Then simply click the
**Next** button.

![image5](/images/rs/image5.png?width=1000&height=611)

If you don't have a license key, click the **Next** button to try the
trial version of the product.

On the next screen, set up a Cluster Administrator account using an
email for the login and a password.

We will repeat the same operations for cluster 2. There are only a few
differences.

- For the node of cluster 2, direct the **https://localhost:8445** to
    set up the cluster 2. Specify **create new cluster** option with the
    cluster FQDN as **cluster2.local** and follow the steps to finish
    setup on this node.

At this point, we have two Redis Enterprise Software clusters with FQDNs
**cluster1.local** and **cluster2.local**.

## Step 3: Create a Redis CRDB

Under the databases tab, choose the Redis database with deployment type
set to Geo-Distributed.

![new_geo-distrbuted](/images/rs/new_geo-distrbuted.png?width=600&height=608)

On the create database page, click the **show advanced option** link and
enter **database1** for the database name and **12000** for the endpoint
port number.

A CRDB is a global database that spans multiple clusters. In this case,
both cluster 1 and cluster 2. On the participating clusters list, add
two clusters; http://cluster1.local:8080 and http://cluster2.local:8080
with the respective admin accounts and password for each cluster. Notice
how we had to add the cluster we are currently on.

Then click **Activate** to create your database.

![create_database_settings](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BpQBxYWXeuTuPCqL0TQKRRJaQlr8jLIMoNnScsD2s0wRzDkTc9kgWwngjQ6PnJff_hF1Ca98aZkJTJzU5Sk5rCJwZmR2egkImQCJyMm9E9WfJDrtlzHUJQFAi05lx395EEOZvi3D)

Once the global CRDB is created, you can now visit each cluster 1 at
http://localhost:8443 and cluster 2 at http://localhost:8445. See that
each cluster has a local CRDB member database under the name database1.
In a real-world deployment, cluster 1 and cluster 2 would most likely be
in separate data centers in different regions. However in this case, for
local testing, we have created the scale-minimized deployment using two
local clusters running on the same host.

## Step 4: Connect to your member Redis CRDBs

With the Redis database created, you are ready to connect to your
database to store data. You can use one of the following ways to test
connectivity to your database

- Connecting with redis-cli, the built-in command-line tool.
- Connecting with a _Hello World_ application using Python.

Remember we have two member CRDBs that are available for connections and
concurrent reads and writes. The member CRDBs are using bi-directional
replication to for the global CRDB.

### Connecting Using redis-cli

redis-cli is a simple command-line tool to interact with redis database.
Use "docker exec" to switch your context into the Redis Enterprise
Software container of node 1 in cluster 1.

```src
$ docker exec -it rp1_node1 bash
```

Run redis-cli, located in the /opt/redislabs/bin directory, to connect
to port 12000 and store and retrieve a key in database1

```src
$ sudo /opt/redislabs/bin/redis-cli -p 12000
127.0.0.1:12000> set key1 123
OK
127.0.0.1:12000> get key1
"123"
```

You can see the write replicated to cluster 2. Use "docker exec" to
switch your context into the Redis Enterprise Software container of node
1 in cluster 2.

```src
$ docker exec -it rp2_node1 bash
$ sudo /opt/redislabs/bin/redis-cli -p 12000
127.0.0.1:12000> get key1
"123"
```

### Connecting Using _Hello World_ Application in Python

A simple python application running on the host machine can also connect
to the database1.

Note: The following section assumes you already have python and redis-py
(python library for connecting to Redis) configured on the host machine
running the container. You can find the instructions to configure
redis-py on the github page for redis-py

In the command-line Terminal, create a new file called "redis_test.py"

```src
$ vi redis_test.py
```

Paste the following into a file named "redis_test.py".

```src
import redis

rp1 = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=12000, db=0)
rp2 = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=12002, db=0)

print ("set key1 123 in cluster 1")
print (rp1.set('key1', '123'))
print ("get key1 cluster 1")
print (rp1.get('key1'))

print ("get key1 from cluster 2")
print (rp2.get('key1'))
```

Run "redis_test.py" application to connect to the database and store
and retrieve a key using the command-line.

```src
$ python redis_test.py
```

The output should look like the following screen if the connection is
successful.

```src
set key1 123 in cluster 1
True
get key1 cluster 1
b'123'
get key1 from cluster 2
b'123'
```
