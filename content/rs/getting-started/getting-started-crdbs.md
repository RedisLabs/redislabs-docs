In this guide, we'll set up a CRDB (conflict-free
replicated database) spanning across two Redis Enterprise Software
clusters for test and development environments. Here are the steps:

- Step 1: Run two RS Docker containers
- Step 2: Setup each container as a cluster
- Step 3: Create a new Redis Enterprise CRDB
- Step 4: Test connectivity to the CRDB

To run a CRDB on installations from the [RS download package]({{< relref "/rs/getting-started/quick-setup.md" >}}), 
setup two RS installations and continue from Step 2.

Note: This getting started guide is for development or demonstration environments.
To setup CRDB in a production environment, use the instuctions for
[creating a CRDB]({{< relref "/rs/administering/database-operations/create-crdb.md" >}}).

## Step 1: Run Two Containers

To spin up two RS containers, run these commands:

```src
$ docker run -d --cap-add sys_resource -h rp1_node1 --name rp1_node1 -p 8443:8443 -p 9443:9443 -p 12000:12000 redislabs/redis
```

```src
$ docker run -d --cap-add sys_resource -h rp2_node1 --name rp2_node1 -p 8445:8443 -p 9445:9443 -p 12002:12000 redislabs/redis
```

The **-p** options map the web UI port (8443), REST API port (9443), and 
database access port differently for each container to make sure that all 
containers can be accessed from the host OS that is running the containers.

## Step 2: Setup Two Clusters

1. For cluster 1, direct your browser to **https://localhost:8443** on the
host machine to see the Redis Enterprise Software web console. Simply
click the **Setup** button on the page to get started.

    Note: Depending on your browser, you may see a certificate error. Continue to 
    the website.

    ![rs-setup](/images/rs/rs-setup.png)

1. On the **node configuration** page, select your default settings and
provide a cluster FQDN, for example `cluster1.local`. Then click
**Next** button.

    ![node-config](/images/rs/node-config.png)

1. If you don't have a license key, click the **Next** button to try the
trial version of the product.

1. On the next screen, set up a Cluster Administrator account using an
email for the login and a password.

    ![set-admin-credentials](/images/rs/set-admin-credentials.png)

1. Click **OK** to confirm that you are aware of the replacement of the HTTPS SSL/TLS 
    certificate on the node, and proceed through the browser warning.

Repeat the same operations for cluster 2 with these differences:

- In your web browser, go to **https://localhost:8445** to
    set up the cluster 2.
- For the **Cluster name (FQDN)**, enter a different name, such as `cluster2.local`.

Now we have two Redis Enterprise Software clusters with FQDNs
**cluster1.local** and **cluster2.local**.

## Step 3: Create a Redis CRDB

1. After you login to cluster1.local, select the Redis database and deployment type
**Geo-Distributed**. Then click **Next**.

    ![new_geo-distrbuted](/images/rs/new_geo-distrbuted.png?width=600&height=608)

1. In **create database**, click the **show advanced option** and:
    
    1. For the **database name**, enter: `database1`
    1. For the **endpoint port number**, enter: `12000`
    1. In the **participating clusters** list, add the address and admin credentials for:
        - `http://cluster1.local:8080` - the cluster you are currently connected to
        - `http://cluster2.local:8080` - the other cluster
    <!-- Also in create-crdb.md -->
    1. In the **Database clustering** option, either:

        - Make sure the Database clustering is enabled and select the number of shards 
        that you want to have in the database. When database clustering is enabled, 
        databases are subject to limitations on [Multi-key commands]({{< relref "/rs/concepts/high-availability/clustering.md" >}}). 
        You can increase the number of shards in the database at any time. 
        - Clear the **Database clustering** option to use only one shard and so 
        that the [Multi-key commands]({{< relref "/rs/concepts/high-availability/clustering.md" >}})
        limitations do not apply.
        
        Note: You cannot enable or disable database clustering after the CRDB is created.

1. Click **Activate** to create your CRDB.

    ![crdb-activate](/images/rs/crdb-activate.png)

    <!-- Also in getting-started-docker.md -->
    Note: If you cannot activate the database because of a memory limitation, 
    make sure that Docker has enough memory allocated in the Advanced section 
    of Docker Settings.

1. After the CRDB is created, you can now visit each cluster 1 at
http://localhost:8443 and cluster 2 at http://localhost:8445.

1. Make sure that each cluster has a CRDB member database with the name `database1`.

    In a real-world deployment, cluster 1 and cluster 2 would most likely be
    in separate data centers in different regions. However, for
    local testing we created the scale-minimized deployment using two
    local clusters running on the same host.

<!-- Also in getting-started-crdbs.md -->
## Step 4: Test the Connection to your Member Redis CRDBs

With the Redis database created, you are ready to connect to your
database to store data. You can use one of the following ways to test
connectivity to your database:

- Connect with redis-cli, the built-in command-line tool
- Connect with a _Hello World_ application written in Python

Remember we have two member CRDBs that are available for connections and
concurrent reads and writes. The member CRDBs are using bi-directional
replication to for the global CRDB.

### Connecting Using redis-cli

redis-cli is a simple command-line tool to interact with redis database.

1. To switch your context into the RS container of node 1 in cluster 1, run:

    ```src
    $ docker exec -it rp1_node1 bash
    ```

1. To use redis-cli on port 12000, run:

    ```src
    $ redis-cli -p 12000
    ```

1.  Store and retrieve a key in the database to test the connection with these 
    commands:
    
    - `set key1 123`
    - `get key1`

    The output of the command looks like this:

    ```src
    127.0.0.1:12000> set key1 123
    OK
    127.0.0.1:12000> get key1
    "123"
    ```

1. Enter `exit` to exit the redis-cli context and enter `exit` again to exit the 
   RS container of node 1 in cluster 1.
1. To see that the key replicated to cluster 2, repeat the steps to switch your 
   context into the RS container of node 1 in cluster 2, run the redis-cli and 
   retrieve key1.

    The output of the commands looks like this:
    ```src
    $ docker exec -it rp2_node1 bash
    $ redis-cli -p 12000
    127.0.0.1:12000> get key1
    "123"
    ```

### Connecting Using _Hello World_ Application in Python

A simple python application running on the host machine can also connect
to the database.

Note: Before you continue, you must have python and 
[redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py#installation)
(python library for connecting to Redis) configured on the host machine
running the container.

1. In the command-line terminal, create a new file called "redis_test.py"

    ```src
    $ vi redis_test.py
    ```

1. Paste this code into the "redis_test.py" file.

    This application stores a value in key1 in cluster 1, gets that value from 
    key1 in cluster 1, and gets the value from key1 in cluster 2.

    ```py
    import redis

    rp1 = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=12000, db=0)
    rp2 = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=12002, db=0)

    print ("set key1 123 in cluster 1")
    print (rp1.set('key1', '123'))
    print ("get key1 cluster 1")
    print (rp1.get('key1'))

    print ("get key1 from cluster 2")
    print (rp2.get('key1'))
    ```

1. To run the "redis_test.py" application, run:

    ```src
    $ python redis_test.py
    ```

    If the connection is successful, the output of the application looks like:

    ```src
    set key1 123 in cluster 1
    True
    get key1 cluster 1
    b'123'
    get key1 from cluster 2
    b'123'
    ```
