If you need to do a quick performance benchmark of Redis Enterprise, we
have a tool just for this; memtier_benchmark.

Prerequisites:

- Redis Enterprise Software installed
- A cluster configured
- A database created

If you need a quick setup for the prerequisites, please [go
here]({{< relref "/rs/getting-started/_index.md" >}}).

It is recommended to run memtier_benchmark on a separate node that is
not part of the cluster being tested. If you run it on a node of the
cluster, be mindful that it affects the performance of both the
cluster and memtier_benchmark.

```sh
/opt/redislabs/bin/memtier_benchmark -s $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT -a $DB_PASSWORD -t 4 -R --ratio=1:1
```

This command instructs memtier_benchmark to connect to your Redis
Enterprise database and generates a load doing the following:

- A 50/50 Set to Get ratio
- Each object has random data in the value

## Populate a database with testing data

If you need to populate a database with some test data for a proof of
concept, or failover testing, etc. here is an example for you.

```sh
/opt/redislabs/bin/memtier_benchmark -s $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT -a $DB_PASSWORD -R -n allkeys -d 500 --key-pattern=P:P --ratio=1:0
```

This command instructs memtier_benchmark to connect to your Redis
Enterprise database and generates a load doing the following:

- Write objects only, no reads
- A 500 byte object
- Each object has random data in the value
- Each key has a random pattern, then a colon, followed by a
    random pattern.

Run this command until it fills up your database to where you want it
for testing. The easiest way to check is on the database metrics page.

Another use for memtier_benchmark is to populate a database with data
for failure testing.
