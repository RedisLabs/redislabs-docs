The Discovery Service provides an IP-based connection management service
used when connecting to Redis Enterprise Software databases. When used
in conjunction with Redis Enterprise Software's other high availability
features, the Discovery Service assists an application scope with
topology changes such as adding, removing of nodes, node failovers and
so on. It does this by providing your application with the ability to
easily discover which node hosts the database endpoint. The API used for
discovery service is compliant with the Redis Sentinel API.

Discovery Service is an alternative for applications that do not want to
depend on DNS name resolution for their connectivity. Discovery Service
and DNS based connectivity are not mutually exclusive. They can be used
side by side in a given cluster where some clients can use Discovery
Service based connection while others can use DNS name resolution when
connecting to databases.

## How discovery service works

The Discovery Service is available for querying on each node of the
cluster, listening on port 8001. To employ it, your application utilizes
a [Redis Sentinel enabled client
library]({{< relref "/rs/databases/connect/supported-clients-browsers.md" >}})
to connect to the Discovery Service and request the endpoint for the
given database. The Discovery Service replies with the database's
endpoint for that database. In case of a node failure, the Discovery
Service is updated by the cluster manager with the new endpoint and
clients unable to connect to the database endpoint due to the failover,
can re-query the discovery service for the new endpoint for the
database.

The Discovery Service can return either the internal or external
endpoint for a database. If you query the discovery service for the
endpoint of a database named "db1", the Discovery Service returns
the external endpoint information by default. If only an internal
endpoint exists with no external endpoint the default behavior is to
return the internal endpoint. The "\@internal" is added to the end of
the database name to explicitly ask for the internal endpoint. to query
the internal endpoint explicitly with database name "db1", you can pass
in the database name as "db1\@internal".

If you'd like to examine the metadata returned from Redis Enterprise
Software Discovery Service you can connect to port 8001 with redis-cli
utility and execute "SENTINEL masters". Following is a sample output
from one of the nodes of a Redis Enterprise Software cluster:

```sh
$ ./redis-cli -p 8001
127.0.0.1:8001> SENTINEL masters
1) 1) "name"
2) "db1@internal"
3) "ip"
4) "10.0.0.45"
5) "port"
6) "12000"
7) "flags"
8) "master,disconnected"
9) "num-other-sentinels"
10) "0"
2) 1) "name"
2) "db1"
3) "ip"
4) "10.0.0.45"
5) "port"
6) "12000"
7) "flags"
8) "master,disconnected"
9) "num-other-sentinels"
10) "0"
```

It is important to note that, the Discovery Service is not a full
implementation of the [Redis Sentinel
protocol](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel). There are aspects of the
protocol that are not applicable or would be duplication with existing
technology in Redis Enterprise Software. The Discovery Service
implements only the parts required to provide applications with easy
High Availability, be compatible with the protocol, and not rely on DNS
to derive which node in the cluster to communicate with.

{{< note >}}
To use Redis Sentinel, every database name must be unique across the cluster.

## Redis client support

We recommend these clients that are tested for use with the [Discovery Service]({{< relref "/rs/databases/durability-ha/discovery-service.md" >}}) that uses the Redis Sentinel API:

{{< embed-md "discovery-clients.md" >}}

{{< note >}}
Redis Sentinel API can return endpoints for both master and replica
endpoints.
Discovery Service only supports master endpoints and does not
support returning replica endpoints for a database.
