In Redis Enterprise, the Replica Of feature provides active-passive geo-distribution to applications  for read-only access
to replicas of the data set from different geographical locations.
The Redis Enterprise implementation of active-passive replication is called Replica Of.

In Replica Of, an administrator designates a database as a replica (destination) of one or more databases (sources).
After the initial data load from source to destination is completed,
all write commands are synchronized from the sources to the destination.
Replica Of lets you distribute the read load of your application across multiple databases or
synchronize the database, either within Redis Enterprise or external to Redis Enterprise, to another database.

You can [create Active-Passive]({{< relref "/rs/databases/create-replica-of.md" >}}) databases on Redis Enterprise Software or Redis Cloud.

[Active-Active Geo-Distribution (CRDB)]({{< relref "/rs/databases/active-active/_index.md" >}})
provides these benefits and also provides write access to all of the database replicas.

{{< warning >}}
Configuring a database as a replica of the database that it replicates
creates a cyclical replication and is not supported.
{{< /warning >}}

The Replica Of is defined in the context of the destination database
by specifying the source databases.

A destination database can have a maximum of thirty-two (32) source
databases.

If only one source is defined, then the command execution order in the
source is kept in the destination. However, when multiple sources are
defined, commands that are replicated from the source databases are
executed in the order in which they reach the destination database. As a
result, commands that were executed in a certain order when compared
across source databases might be executed in a different order on the
destination database.

{{< note >}}
The Replica Of feature should not be confused with the
in-memory [Database
replication]({{< relref "/rs/concepts/high-availability/replication.md" >}})
feature, which is used for creating a master / slave configuration that
enables ensuring database high-availability.

## Replication process

When a database is defined as a replica of another database, all its
existing data is deleted and replaced by data that is loaded from the
source database.

Once the initial data load is completed, an ongoing synchronization
process takes place to keep the destination always synchronized with its
source. During the ongoing synchronization process, there is a certain
delay between the time when a command was executed on the source and
when it is executed on the destination. This delay is referred to as the
**Lag**.

When there is a **synchronization error**, **the process might stop** or
it might continue running on the assumption that the error automatically
resolves. The result depends on the error type. See more details below.

In addition, **the user can manually stop the synchronization process**.

When the process is in the stopped state - whether stopped by the user
or by the system - the user can restart the process. **Restarting the
process causes the synchronization process to flush the DB and restart
the process from the beginning**.

### Replica Of status

The replication process can have the following statuses:

- **Syncing** - indicates that the synchronization process has
    started from scratch. Progress is indicated in percentages (%).
- **Synced** - indicates that the initial synchronization process was
    completed and the destination is synchronizing changes on an ongoing
    basis. The **Lag** delay in synchronization with the source is
    indicated as a time duration.
- **Sync stopped** - indicates that the synchronization process is
    currently not running and the user needs to restart it in order for
    it to continue running. This status happens if the user stops the
    process, or if certain errors arose that prevent synchronization
    from continuing without manual intervention. See more details below.

The statuses above are shown for the source database. In addition, a
timestamp is shown on the source indicating when the last command from
the source was executed on the destination.

The system also displays the destination database status as an aggregate
of the statuses of all the sources.

If you encounter issues with the Replica Of process, refer
to the troubleshooting section [Replica Of repeatedly
fails]({{< relref "/rs/administering/troubleshooting/replicaof-repeatedly-fails.md" >}}).

### Synchronization errors

Certain errors that occur during the synchronization process require
user intervention for their resolution. When such errors occur, the
synchronization process is automatically stopped.

For other errors, the synchronization process continues running on the
assumption that the error automatically resolves.

Examples of errors that require user intervention for their resolution
and that stop the synchronization process include:

- Error authenticating with the source database.
- Cross slot violation error while executing a command on a sharded
    destination database.
- Out-of-memory error on a source or on the destination
    database.

Example of an error that does not cause the synchronization process to
stop:

- Connection error with the source database. A connection error might
    occur occasionally, for example as result of temporary network
    issues that get resolved. Depending on the connection error and its
    duration the process might be able to start syncing from the last
    point it reached (partial sync) or require a complete
    resynchronization from scratch across all sources (full sync).

## Encryption

Replica Of supports the ability to encrypt uni-directional replication
communications between source and destination clusters utilizing TLS 1.2
based encryption.

## Data compression for Replica Of

When the Replica Of is defined across different Redis Enterprise
Software clusters, it may be beneficial to compress the data that flows
through the network (depending on where the clusters physically reside
and the available network).

Compressing the data reduces the traffic and can help:

- Resolve throughput issues
- Reduce network traffic costs

Compressing the data does have trade-offs, which is why it should not
always be turned on by default. For example:

- It uses CPU and disk resources to compress the data before sending
    it to the network and decompress it on the other side.
- It takes time to compress and decompress the data which can increase
    latency.
- Replication is disk-based and done gradually, shard by shard in the
    case of a multi-shard database. This may have an impact on
    replication times depending on the speed of the disks and load on
    the database.
- If traffic is too fast and the compression takes too much time it
    can cause the replication process to fail and be restarted.

It is advised that you test compression out in a lower environment
before enabling it in production.

In the Redis Enterprise Software management UI, when designating a
Replica Of source from a different Redis Enterprise Software cluster,
there is also an option to enable compression. When enabled, gzip
compression with level -6 is utilized.

## Database clustering (sharding) implications

If a **source** database is sharded, that entire database is treated as
a single source for the destination database.

If the **destination** database is sharded, when the commands replicated
from the source are executed on the destination database, the
destination database's hashing function is executed to determine to
which shard/s the command refers.

The source and destination can have different shard counts and functions
for placement of keys.

### Synchronization in Active-Passive Replication

In Active-Passive databases, one cluster hosts the source database that receives read-write operations
and the other clusters host destination databases that receive synchronization updates from the source database.

When there is a significant difference between the source and destination databases,
the destination database flushes all of the data from its memory and starts synchronizing the data again.
This process is called a **full sync**.

For example, if the database updates for the destination databases
that are stored by the destination database in a synchronization backlog exceed their allocated memory,
the source database starts a full sync.

{{% warning %}}
When you failover to the destination database for write operations,
make sure that you disable **Replica Of** before you direct clients to the destination database.
This avoids a full sync that can overwrite your data.
