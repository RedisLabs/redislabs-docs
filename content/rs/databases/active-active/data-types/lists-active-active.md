Redis lists are simply lists of strings, sorted by insertion order. It
is possible to add elements to a Redis List that push new elements to
the head (on the left) or to the tail (on the right) of the list. Redis
Lists can be used to easily implement queues (using LPUSH and RPOP, for
example) and stacks (using LPUSH and LPOP, for
example).

Lists in Active-Active databases are just the same as regular Redis Lists. See the
following examples to get familiar with Lists' behavior in an
Active-Active database.

Simple Lists
example:

|  **Time** | **CRDB Instance 1** | **CRDB Instance 2** |
|  ------: | :------: | :------: |
|  t1 | LPUSH mylist “hello” |  |
|  t2 | — Sync — | — Sync — |
|  t3 |  | LPUSH mylist “world” |
|  t4 | — Sync — | — Sync — |
|  t5 | LRANGE mylist 0 -1 =>“world” “hello” | LRANGE mylist 0 -1 => “world” “hello” |

**Explanation**:
The final list contains both the "world" and "hello" elements, in that
order (Instance 2 observed "hello" when it added
"world").

Example of Lists with Concurrent
Insertions:

|  **Time** | **CRDB Instance 1** | **CRDB Instance 2** |
|  ------: | :------: | :------: |
|  t1 | LPUSH L x |  |
|  t2 | — Sync — | — Sync — |
|  t3 | LINSERT L AFTER x y1 |  |
|  t4 |  | LINSERT L AFTER x y2 |
|  t5 | LRANGE L 0 -1 => x y1 | LRANGE L 0 -1 => x y2 |
|  t6 | — Sync — | — Sync — |
|  t7 | LRANGE L 0 -1 => x y1 y2 | LRANGE L 0 -1 => x y1 y2 |

**Explanation**:
Instance 1 added an element y1 after x, and then Instance 2 added element y2 after x.
The final List contains all three elements: x is the first element, after it y1 and then y2.
The Active-Active database resolves the conflict arbitrarily but applies the resolution consistently across all Active-Active database instances.

Example of Deleting a List while Pushing a New
Element:

|  **Time** | **CRDB Instance 1** | **CRDB Instance 2** |
|  ------: | :------: | :------: |
|  t1 | LPUSH L x |  |
|  t2 | — Sync — | — Sync — |
|  t3 | LRANGE L 0 -1 => x | LRANGE L 0 -1 => x |
|  t4 | LPUSH L y | DEL L |
|  t5 | — Sync — | — Sync — |
|  t6 | LRANGE L 0 -1 => y | LRANGE L 0 -1 => y |

**Explanation**
At t4 - t6, DEL deletes only observed elements. This is why L still
contains y.

Example of Popping Elements from a
List:

|  **Time** | **CRDB Instance 1** | **CRDB Instance 2** |
|  ------: | :------: | :------: |
|  t1 | LPUSH L x y z |  |
|  t2 | — Sync — | — Sync — |
|  t3 |  | RPOP L => x |
|  t4 | — Sync — | — Sync — |
|  t5 | RPOP L => y |  |
|  t6 | — Sync — | — Sync — |
|  t7 | RPOP L => z | RPOP L => z |

**Explanation**:
At t1, the operation pushes elements x, y, z to List L. At t3, the
sequential pops behave as expected from a queue. At t7, the concurrent
pop in both instances might show the same result. The instance was not
able to sync regarding the z removal so, from the point of view of each
instance, z is located in the List and can be popped. After syncing,
both lists are empty.

Be aware of the behavior of Lists in Active-Active databases when using List as a stack
or queue. As seen in the above example, two parallel RPOP operations
performed by two different Active-Active database instances can get the same element in
the case of a concurrent operation. Lists in Active-Active databases guarantee that each
element is POP-ed at least once, but cannot guarantee that each
element is POP-ed only once. Such behavior should be taken into
account when, for example, using Lists in Active-Active databases as building blocks for
inter-process communication systems.

In that case, if the same element cannot be handled twice by the
applications, it's recommended that the POP operations be performed by
one Active-Active database instance, whereas the PUSH operations can be performed by
multiple instances.
