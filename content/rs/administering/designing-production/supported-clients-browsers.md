You can configure Redis Enterprise Software (RS) programmatically with client libraries
or manually with the RS Web Console.

## Redis client libraries

For connecting to RS databases with your
Redis application, you can use any of the available [client libraries
listed on Redis.io](https://redis.io/clients).

### Discovery service

We recommend these clients that are tested for use with the [Discovery Service]({{< relref "/rs/concepts/data-access/discovery-service.md" >}}) that uses the Redis Sentinel API:
