Title: Multiple Active Proxy Support

Redis Enterprise Software (RS) provides high-performance data access
through a proxy process that manages and optimizes access to shards
within the RS cluster. Each node contains a single proxy process.
Each proxy can be active and take incoming traffic or it can be passive
and wait for failovers.

RS allows multiple databases to be created. Each database gets an
endpoint (a unique URL and port on the FQDN). This endpoint receives all
the traffic for all operations for that database. By default, RS binds
this database endpoint to one of the proxies on a single node in the
cluster. This proxy becomes an active proxy and receives all the
operations for the given database. (note that if the node with the
active proxy fails, a new proxy on another node takes over as part of
the failover process automatically).

In most cases, a single proxy can handle a large number of operations
without consuming additional resources. However, under high load,
network bandwidth or a high rate of packets per second (PPS) on the
single active proxy can become a bottleneck to how fast database
operation can be performed. In such cases, having multiple active
proxies, across multiple nodes, mapped to the same external database
endpoint, can significantly improve throughput.

With the multiple active proxies capability, RS enables you to configure
a database to have multiple internal proxies in order to improve
performance, in some cases. It is important to note that, even though
multiple active proxies can help improve the throughput of database
operations, configuring multiple active proxies may cause additional
latency in operations as the shards and proxies are spread across
multiple nodes in the cluster.

Note: When the network on a single active proxy becomes the bottleneck,
you might also look into enabling the multiple NIC support in RS. With
nodes that have multiple physical NICs (Network Interface Cards), you
can configure RS to separate internal and external traffic onto
independent physical NICs. For more details, refer to [Multi-IP &
IPv6]({{< relref "/rs/administering/designing-production/networking/multi-ip-ipv6.md" >}}).

Having multiple proxies for a database can improve RS's ability for fast
failover in case of proxy and/or node failure. With multiple proxies for
a database, there is no need for a client to wait for the cluster
to spin up another proxy and a DNS change in most cases, the client
just uses the next IP in the list to connect to another proxy.

## Proxy policies

A database can have one of these proxy policies:

| **Proxy Policy** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| Single | There is only a single proxy that is bound to the database. This is the default database configuration and preferable in most use cases. |
| All Master Shards | There are multiple proxies that are bound to the database, one on each node that hosts a database master shard. This mode fits most use cases that require multiple proxies. |
| All Nodes | There are multiple proxies that are bound to the database, one on each node in the cluster, regardless of whether or not there is a shard from this database on the node. This mode should be used only in special cases. |

Note: Manual intervention is also available via the rladmin bind add and
remove commands.

## Database configuration

A database can be configured with a proxy policy using rladmin bind.

Warning: Any configuration update which causes existing proxies to be
unbounded can cause existing client connections to get disconnected.

You can run rladmin to control and view the existing settings for proxy
configuration.

The **info** command on cluster returns the existing proxy policy for
sharded and non-sharded (single shard) databases.

```sh
$ rladmin info cluster
cluster configuration:
   repl_diskless: enabled
   default_non_sharded_proxy_policy: single
   default_sharded_proxy_policy: single
   default_shards_placement: dense
   default_shards_overbooking: disabled
   default_fork_evict_ram: enabled
   default_redis_version: 3.2
   redis_migrate_node_threshold: 0KB (0 bytes)
   redis_migrate_node_threshold_percent: 8 (%)
   redis_provision_node_threshold: 0KB (0 bytes)
   redis_provision_node_threshold_percent: 12 (%)
   max_simultaneous_backups: 4
   watchdog profile: local-network
```

You can configure the proxy policy using the `bind` command in
rladmin. The following command is an example that changes the bind
policy for a database called "db1" with an endpoint id "1:1" to "All
Master Shards" proxy policy.

```sh
rladmin bind db db1 endpoint 1:1 policy all-master-shards
```

Note: you can find the endpoint id for the endpoint argument by running
*status* command for rladmin. Look for the endpoint id information under
the *ENDPOINT* section of the output.

### Reapply policies after topology changes

If you want to reapply the policy after topology changes, such as node restarts,
failovers and migrations, run this command to reset the policy:

```sh
rladmin bind db <db_name> endpoint <endpoint id> policy <all-master-shards|all-nodes>
```

This is not required with single policies.

#### Other implications

During the regular operation of the cluster different actions might take
place, such as automatic migration or automatic failover, which change
what proxy needs to be bound to what database. When such actions take
place the cluster attempts, as much as possible, to automatically change
proxy bindings to adhere to the defined policies. That said, the cluster
attempts to prevent any existing client connections from being
disconnected, and hence might not entirely enforce the policies. In such
cases, you can enforce the policy using the appropriate rladmin
commands.
