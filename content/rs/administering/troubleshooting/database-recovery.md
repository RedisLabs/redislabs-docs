When a cluster fails or a database is corrupted, you must:

1. [Restore the cluster configuration]({{< relref "/rs/administering/troubleshooting/cluster-recovery.md" >}}) from the CCS files
1. Recover the databases with their previous configuration and data

To restore the data that was in the databases to databases in the new cluster
you must restore the database persistence files (backup, AOF, or snapshot files) to the databases.
These files are stored in the [persistence storage location]({{< relref "/rs/administering/designing-production/persistent-ephemeral-storage.md" >}}).
    
The database recovery process includes:

1. If the cluster failed, [recover the cluster]({{< relref "/rs/administering/troubleshooting/cluster-recovery.md" >}}).
1. Identify recoverable databases.
1. Restore the database data.
1. Verify that the databases are active.

## Prerequisites

- Before you start database recovery, make sure that the cluster that hosts the database is healthy.
    In the case of a cluster failure,
    you must [recover the cluster]({{< relref "/rs/administering/troubleshooting/cluster-recovery.md" >}}) before you recover the databases.

- We recommend that you allocate new persistent storage drives for the new cluster nodes.
    If you use the original storage drives,
    make sure that you backup all files on the old persistent storage drives to another location.

## Recovering the databases

After you prepare the cluster that hosts the database,
you can run the recovery process from the [rladmin]({{< relref "/rs/references/rladmin.md" >}})
command-line interface (CLI).

To recover the database:

1. Mount the persistent storage drives with the recovery files to the new nodes.
    These drives must contain the cluster configuration backup files and database persistence files.

    {{< note >}}
Make sure that the user redislabs has permissions to access the storage location
of the configuration and persistence files on each of the nodes.
    {{< /note >}}

    If you use local persistent storage, place all of the recovery files on each of the cluster nodes.

1. To see which databases are recoverable, run:

    ```sh
    rladminÂ recover list
    ```

    The status for each database can be either ready for recovery or missing files.
    An indication of missing files in any of the databases can result from:

    - The storage location is not found
    - Cannot read the persistence files, such as: no permission to read the files, missing files, or corrupted files

    If the output shows that there are missing files,
    make sure that the recovery path is set correctly on all of the nodes in the cluster.
    If that does not resolve the issues, contact [Redis Labs Support](mailto:support@redislabs.com).

1. You can either recover the databases all at once or specify the database to recover:

    - To recover all of the databases, run: `rladmin recover all`
    - To recover a single databases, run: `rladmin recover db <database_id|name>`

    All databases are recovered with the same data that they had in the old cluster.
    The data is recovered from the persistence files located in the persistent storage drives
    that you mounted to the nodes.

    - If AOF or snapshot is available, the data is restored from the AOF or snapshot. Active-Active database instances are then synced with the other participating clusters to update with data changed since the AOF or snapshot (fast Active-Active sync).

        If AOF or snapshot is available for an Active-Active database but you want to get all of the data from the other participating clusters (slow Active-Active sync), use: `recover db only_configuration <db_name>`

    - If AOF or snapshot is not available, the database is restored empty. Active-Active database instances are synced with the other participating clusters (slow Active-Active sync).

    {{< note >}}
If the persistence files of the databases from the old cluster are not stored in the persistent storage location of the new node,
you must first map the recovery path of each node to the location of the old persistence files.
To do this, run the `node <id> recovery_path set` command in rladmin.
The persistence files for each database are located in the persistent storage path of the nodes from the old cluster, under the /redis directory.

1. To verify that the recovered databases are now active, run: `rladmin status`

After the databases are recovered, make sure that your redis clients can successfully connect to the databases.
