Nodes in the same cluster must reside on the same VLAN. If you cannot
host the nodes on the same VLAN then you must configure all ports
between them to be open. For additional details, refer to [network port
configuration]({{< relref "/rs/administering/designing-production/networking/port-configurations.md" >}}).
