If you encounter any issues that you are not able to resolve yourself
and need to contact Redis Labs support for assistance, you can create a
support package that gathers all essential information to help us debug
your issues.

## Creating a support package

To create a support package:

1. Click **Support** at the top right of the management UI.
1. Click **Create Support Package** at the bottom of the page, and
    confirm the action.

The package is created and downloaded to your browser.

Note that creating a support package might take several minutes and
might overload the system; therefore, do not attempt to initiate this
process unless it is necessary.
