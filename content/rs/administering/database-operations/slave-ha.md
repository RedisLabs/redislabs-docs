When you enable [database replication]({{< relref "/rs/concepts/high-availability/replication.md" >}})
for your database, RS replicates your data to a slave node to make sure that your
data is highly available. Whether the slave node fails or the master node fails
and the slave is promoted to master, the remaining master node is a
single point of failure.

You can configure high availability for slave shards (slave HA) so that the cluster
automatically migrates the slave shards to another available node. In practice, slave
migration creates a new slave shard and replicates the data from the master shard to the
new slave shard. For example:

1. Node:2 has a master shard and node:3 has the corresponding the slave shard.
1. Either:

    - Node:2 fails and the slave shard on node:3 is promoted to master.
    - Node:3 fails and the master shard is no longer replicated.

1. If slave HA is enabled, a new slave shard is created on an available node
    that does not hold the master shard.

    All of the constraints of shard migration apply, such as [rack-awareness]({{< relref "/rs/concepts/high-availability/rack-zone-awareness.md" >}}).

1. The data from the master shard is replicated to the new slave shard.

## Configuring High Availability for Slave Shards

You can enable slave HA using rladmin or using the REST API either for:

- Cluster - All databases in the cluster use slave HA
- Database - Only the specified database uses slave HA

By default, slave HA is set to disabled at the cluster level and enabled at the
database level, with the cluster level overriding, so that:

- To enable slave HA for all databases in the cluster - Enable slave HA for the cluster
- To enable slave HA for only specified databases in the cluster:
    1. Enable slave HA for the cluster
    1. Disable slave HA for the databases for which you do not want slave HA enabled

To enable slave HA for a cluster using rladmin, run:

    rladmin tune cluster slave_ha enabled

To disable slave HA for a specific database using rladmin, run:

    rladmin tune db <bdb_uid> slave_ha disabled

## Slave HA Configuration Options

You can see the current configuration options for slave HA with: `rladmin info cluster`

### Grace Period

By default, slave HA has a 15-minute grace period after node failure and before new slave shards are created.
To configure this grace period from rladmin, run:

    rladmin tune cluster slave_ha_grace_period <time_in_seconds>

### Shard Priority

Slave shard migration is based on priority so that, in the case of limited memory resources, the most important slave shards are migrated first. Slave HA migrates slave shards for databases according to this order of priority:

1. slave_ha_priority - The slave shards of the database with the higher slave_ha_priority
    integer value are migrated first.

    To assign priority to a database, run:

    ```
    rladmin tune db <bdb_uid> slave_ha_priority <positive integer>
    ```

1. CRDBs - The CRDB synchronization uses slave shards to synchronize between the replicas.
1. Database size - It is easier and more efficient to move slave shards of smaller databases.
1. Database UID - The slave shards of databases with a higher UID is moved first.

### Cooldown Periods

Both the cluster and the database have cooldown periods. After node failure, the cluster
cooldown period prevents another slave migration due to another node failure for any
databases in the cluster until the cooldown period ends  (Default: 1 hour).

After a database is migrated with slave HA, it cannot go through another slave migration
due to another node failure until the cooldown period for the database ends (Default: 24
hours).

To configure this grace period from rladmin, run:

- For the cluster:

    ```
    rladmin tune cluster slave_ha_cooldown_period <time_in_seconds>
    ```

- For all databases in the cluster:

    ```
    rladmin tune cluster slave_ha_bdb_cooldown_period <time_in_seconds>
    ```

### Alerts

The following alerts are sent during slave HA activation:

- Shard migration begins after the grace period
- Shard migration fails because there is no available node (Sent hourly)
- Shard migration is delayed because of the cooldown period
