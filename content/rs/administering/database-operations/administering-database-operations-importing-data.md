When importing data into a CRDB, there are two options:

- Perform a flushall to the database, thus deleting all data. Then
        import the data into the CRDB.
- Import data but merge it into the existing or add new data from
        the import file.

When you
import data into a CRDB, there will be a special prompt such as the
below.
