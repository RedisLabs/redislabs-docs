You can choose which metrics are shown in each of the two detailed
graphs at the top of the page, as follows:

- Below the top two graphs there is a group of smaller graphs that
    display all available metrics, such as CPU utilization and
    operations per second.
- In each of the bottom graphs, you can click the left arrow to
    display that metric in the top left graph, and the right arrow to
    display that metric in the top right graph.

In addition, the scale selector at the top of the page allows you to set
the scale of the graphs' X-axis (time).
