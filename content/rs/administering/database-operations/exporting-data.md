You can [schedule backups]({{< relref "/rs/administering/database-operations/exporting-data.md" >}})
of a specific Redis Enterprise Software (RS) database to make sure you always have valid backups.
You can also export the data from a specific database at any time.

You can export a database to these locations:

- FTP server
- SFTP server
- Amazon AWS S3
- Local mount point
- OpenStack Swift (Object Storage)
- Azure Blob Storage
- Google Cloud Storage

The backup process creates compressed (.gz) RDB files that you can [import into a database]({{< relref "/rs/administering/database-operations/importing-data.md" >}}).
If you backup a database configured for database clustering,
RS copies a backup file for each shard to the specified backup location.

{{< note >}}
Make sure that you have enough space available in your storage location.
If there is not enough space in the backup location, the backup fails.
