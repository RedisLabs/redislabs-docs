You can [schedule backups]({{< relref "/rs/administering/database-operations/exporting-data.md" >}})
of a specific database to make sure you always have valid backups.
You can also export the data from a specific database at any time.

You can export a database to these locations:

- FTP server
- SFTP server
- Amazon S3
- Local mount point
- OpenStack Swift (Object Storage)

Other cloud storage options, including Azure Geo-Redundant Storage and Google Cloud Storage,
are planned for a future release.

The backup process creates compressed (.gz) RDB files that you can [import into a database]
({{< relref "/rs/administering/database-operations/importing-data.md" >}}).
If you backup a database configured for database clustering,
RS copies a backup file for each shard to the specified backup location.

Make sure that you have enough space available in your storage location.
If there is not enough space in the backup location, the backup fails.
