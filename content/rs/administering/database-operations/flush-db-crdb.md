To delete the data in a database without deleting the database configuration,
you can flush the data from the database.

{{< warning title="Data Loss Warning" >}}
The flush command deletes ALL in-memory and persistence data in the database.
We recommend that you [backup your database]({{< relref "/rs/administering/database-operations/database-backup.md" >}}) before you flush the data.
{{< /warning >}}

## Flushing data from a database

From the command line, you can flush a database with the redis-cli command or with your favorite Redis client.

To flush data from a database with the redis-cli, run:

```sh
redis-cli -h <hostname> -p <portnumber> -a <password> flushall
```

Example:

```sh
redis-cli -h redis-12345.cluster.local -p 12345 -a xyz flushall
```

## Flushing data from an Active-Active database

When you flush an Active-Active database (formerly known as CRDB), all of the replicas flush their data at the same time.

To flush data from an Active-Active database:

- Web UI

    1. Go to **database** and select the Active-Active database that you want to flush.
    1. Go to **configuration** and click **Flush** at the bottom of the page.
    1. Enter the name of the Active-Active database to confirm that you want to flush the data.

- Command line

    1. To find the ID of the Active-Active database, run:

        ```sh
        crdb-cli crdb list
        ```

        For example:

        ```sh
        $ crdb-cli crdb list
        CRDB-GUID                                NAME                 REPL-ID CLUSTER-FQDN
        a16fe643-4a7b-4380-a5b2-96109d2e8bca     crdb1                1       cluster1.local
        a16fe643-4a7b-4380-a5b2-96109d2e8bca     crdb1                2       cluster2.local
        a16fe643-4a7b-4380-a5b2-96109d2e8bca     crdb1                3       cluster3.local
        ```

    1. To flush the Active-Active database, run:

        ```sh
        crdb-cli crdb flush --crdb-guid <CRDB_GUID>
        ```

        The command output contains the task ID of the flush task, for example:

        ```sh
        $ crdb-cli crdb flush --crdb-guid a16fe643-4a7b-4380-a5b2-96109d2e8bca
        Task 63239280-d060-4639-9bba-fc6a242c19fc created
        ---> Status changed: queued -> started
        ```

    1. To check the status of the flush task, run:

        ```sh
        crdb-cli task status --task-id <Task-ID>
        ```

        For example:

        ```sh
        $ crdb-cli task status --task-id 63239280-d060-4639-9bba-fc6a242c19fc
        Task-ID: 63239280-d060-4639-9bba-fc6a242c19fc
        CRDB-GUID: -
        Status: finished
        ```

- REST API

    1. To find the ID of the Active-Active database, run:

        ```sh
        curl -v -u <user>:<password> -X GET https://<cluster-fqdn>:9443/v1/crdbs
        ```

    1. To flush the Active-Active database, run:

        ```sh
        curl -v -u <username>:<password> -X PUT https://<cluster-fqdn>:9443/v1/crdbs/<guid>/flush
        ```

        The command output contains the task ID of the flush task.

    1. To check the status of the flush task, run:

        ```sh
        curl -v -u <username>:<password> https://<cluster-fqdn>:9443/v1/crdb_tasks/<task-id>
        ```
