There are some special considerations that are important when installing
and running Redis Enterprise Software (RS) on an AWS instances.

Storage Considerations
======================

AWS instances are ephemeral, but your persistent database storage should
not be. If you require a persistent storage location for your database,
the storage must be located outside of the instance. Therefore, when you
set up an instance ensure that it has a properly sized EBS backed volume
connected. Later, when setting up RS on the instance, ensure that the
persistence storage (for additional details, refer to [Persistent and
ephemeral
storage]({{< relref "/rs/administering/designing-production/persistent-ephemeral-storage.md" >}})
is configured to use this volume.

Note: After installing the RS package on the instance (for additional
details, refer to [Accessing and installing the setup
package]({{< relref "/rs/administering/installing-upgrading/downloading-installing.md" >}})
and **before** running through the setup process (for additional
details, refer to [Initial setup - creating a new
cluster]({{< relref "/rs/administering/cluster-operations/new-cluster-setup.md" >}}),
you must give the group 'redislabs' permissions to the EBS volume by
running the following command from the OS command-line interface (CLI):
chown redislabs:redislabs /\< ebs folder name \>

Another feature that may be of importance to you is the use of
Provisioned IOPS for EBS backed volumes. Provisioned IOPS guarantee a
certain level of disk performance. There are two features in RS where
this feature could be critical to use:

1. When using [Redis on
    Flash]({{< relref "/rs/concepts/memory-architecture/redis-flash.md" >}})
1. When using AOF on every write and there is a high write load. In
    this case, the provisioned IOPS should be on the nodes used as
    slaves in the cluster.

Instance Types
==============

Choose an instance type that has (at minimum) enough free memory and
disk space to meet RS's [hardware
requirements]({{< relref "/rs/administering/designing-production/hardware-requirements.md" >}}).

In addition, some instance types are optimized for EBS backed volumes
and some are not. If you are using persistent storage, you should use an
instance type that is, if disk drain rate matters to your database
implementation.

Security
========

When configuring the Security Group:

- Define a custom TCP rule for port 8443 to allow web browser access
    to the RS management UI from the IP address/ range you will use to
    access the UI.
- If you are using the DNS resolving option with RS, define a DNS UDP
    rule for port 53 to allow access to the databases' endpoints by
    using the DNS resolving mechanism. For additional details, refer to
    DNS.
- If you would like to create a cluster that has multiple nodes all
    running as instances on AWS, you need to define a security group
    that has an All TCP rule for all ports, 0 - 65535, and add it to
    all instances that are part of the cluster. This will ensure that
    all nodes are able to communicate with each other. If you would not
    like to open all TCP ports and instead define specific ports and
    ports ranges, refer to Machine ports configuration for a
    comprehensive list of ports being used.

After successfully launching the instances, setup the cluster as
described in [Initial setup - creating a new
cluster]({{< relref "/rs/administering/cluster-operations/new-cluster-setup.md" >}}).
