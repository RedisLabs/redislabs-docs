This document explains the structure of Redis Enterprise Software (RS)
log entries that go into rsyslog and how to use these log entries to
identify events.

## Logging concepts

RS adds to the log different log entries, from various cluster
components, for various events and actions that take place in the
cluster.

There might be many different log entries for a specific event that can
be perceived externally as a single event.

For example, in order for the cluster to decide that a cluster node is
down there might be various log entries added by different cluster
components from various nodes with different descriptions, until the
cluster gets to a final decision that the node is actually down. In
other cases, similar entries might be added to the log and the cluster
eventually gets to a decision that the node is
actually not down.

In addition, some actions that might seem to the user as an atomic
action, like removing a node from the cluster, are actually made up of
several different events that take place in a sequence, and might also
fail in the process.

As a result, Redis Labs enabled that by default all logs entries that
are shown in the log page in the management UI are also written to
syslog. Then rsyslog can be configured to monitor the syslog. All alerts
are logged to syslog if the alerts are configured to be enabled, in
addition to other log entries.

The log entries can be categorized into events and alerts. Events just
get logged, while alerts have a state attached to them. In the Mapping
UI events and alerts to log entries section below, there is a Category
column that calls out for each event whether it is an event or alert. RS
log entries include information about the specific event that occurred
as detailed below in the Log entry structure section. In addition,
rsyslog can be configured to add other information, like the event
severity for example.

Since rsyslog entries do not include the severity information by
default, you can use the following instructions in order to log that
information (in Ubuntu):
Add the following line to /etc/rsyslog.conf
$template TraditionalFormatWithPRI,"%pri-text%:%timegenerated%:%HOSTNAME%:%syslogtag%:%msg:::drop-last-lf%\n"

And modify $ActionFileDefaultTemplate to use your new template
$ActionFileDefaultTemplateTraditionalFormatWithPRI
Make sure to save the changes and restart rsyslog in order for the
changes to take effect. You can see the alerts and events under /var/log
in messages log file.

**Command components:**

- \%pri­text% ­adds the severity
- \%timegenerated% ­adds the timestamp
- \%HOSTNAME% ­adds the machine name
- \%syslogtag% ­the RS message as detailed below in the Log entry
    structure section
    below.
- \%msg:::drop­last­lf%n ­ removes duplicated log entries

### Log entry structure

The log entries have the following basic structure:
event_log\[\]:{\<list of key value pairs in any order\>}

- event_log­ plain static text is always shown at the beginning
    of the entry.
- processid­ the id of the process the logging in running under.
- listofkeyvaluepairsinanyorder­ a list of key value pairs describing
    the
    specific event. The key­values pairs can appear in any order. Some
    key­value pairs are always shown, and some appear depending on the specific event.
    - **Key­value pairs that always appear:**
        - "type" A unique code­name identifying the event logged. For
            the list of
            codenames relevant for this purpose please review the event
            code­name
            column in the Mapping UI events and alerts to log entries
            section below.
        - "object" has the format of "\[:\]". Defines the
            object type, and id if relevant, of the object this event is
            related to. For
            example cluster, node with id, bdb with id, etc'.
        - "time" unix time, can be ignored in this context.
    - **Key­value pairs that might appear depending on the specific
        entry:**
        - "state" boolean with value true or false. This is relevant
            only for
            entries from category alert. True means that the alert is
            on. False means
            that the alert is off.
        - "global_threshold" a value of a threshold for alerts
            related to the
            "cluster"or "node"objects.
        - "threshold" a value of a threshold for alerts related to the
            "bdb"
            object.
