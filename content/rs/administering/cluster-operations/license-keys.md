The cluster key (or license) enables features and capacity within Redis Enterprise Software (RS).
You can add or update a cluster key at any time in a cluster lifecycle.
When the cluster does not have a cluster key, the cluster is in trial mode.

## Trial mode

Trial mode is limited to thirty days and a total of four shards, including master and slave
shards. Any new installation starts its thirty-day clock from the day
the cluster setup was done (with the first cluster node provisioned).
This mode allows all features to be enabled, including Redis on Flash,
during the trial period.

## Viewing the cluster key

You can see the cluster key either:

- Web UI - Go to: **settings** > **general**

    The cluster key string is shown.
- REST API - GET `https://localhost:9443/v1/license`

    The REST API response includes:
    - license - The cluster name (FQDN) in the key string
    - expired - If the cluster key is expired (True or False)
    - activation_date - The date of the cluster key activation
    - expiration_date - The date of the cluster key expiration
    - shards_limit - The number of shards allowed by the cluster key

## Adding or updating a cluster key

{{< note >}}
After you add a cluster key, you cannot remove the key to return the cluster to trial mode.
{{< /note >}}

You can add a cluster key to the cluster either:

- During cluster setup using the web UI or CLI
- After cluster setup using the web UI -
    Go to **settings** > **general**, paste your cluster key into the **cluster key** field, and click the **Save** button.

An existing cluster key can be updated at any time provided the new
cluster license key is valid.Â If saving of a new cluster key fails, the
operation returns the error "invalid license key". In this case, the
existing key stays in effect.

## Expired cluster key

When the license is expired:

- You cannot do these actions:

    - Change database settings including security and configuration options
    - Add/remove a database
    - Upgrade a database to a new version
    - Add/remove a node

- You can do these actions:

    - Login to the web UI and view settings and metrics at all resolutions
        for the cluster, nodes and databases
    - Change cluster settings including license key, security for administrators, and cluster alerts
    - Failover when a node fails and explicitly migrate shard between nodes
    - Upgrade node to a new RS version
