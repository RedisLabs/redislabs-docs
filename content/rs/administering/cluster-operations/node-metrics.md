On the **Node \> Metrics** page you can view detailed graphs of various
node metrics in real-time.

You can choose which metrics are shown in each of the two graphs at the
top of the page, as follows:

- Below the top two graphs there is a group of smaller graphs that
    displays all available **metrics**, such as CPU utilization and
    operations per second.
- In each of the bottom graphs, clicking the left arrow displays that
    metric in the top left graph, while clicking the right arrow
    displays that metric in the top right graph.

In addition, the scale selector at the top of the page allows you to set
the scale of the graphs' X-axis (time).
