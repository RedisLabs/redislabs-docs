Redis Enterprise Software (RS) includes many useful metrics give you
a detailed picture of what is going on in the cluster, node, database,
and shard. For Redis on Flash (ROF) databases, additional metrics are
available.

## Standard Metrics

| Metric | Components measured | Description | More information |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Connections | Cluster, Node, Database | Number of connections used to access the database |  |
| CPU usage | Cluster, Node | Percent usage of the CPU |  |
| Evicted objects/sec | Database, Shard | Number of objects evicted per second | The eviction process is taken place if:<br>1. The database reaches its memory_limit;<br><br>2. The eviction policy allows eviction; i.e. it is not configured to ‘no-eviction’<br><br>3. The dataset keys are compliant with the selected eviction policy. For example: volatile-lru eviction policy, only applied to keys which are violated, such as with TTL set |
| Expired objects/sec | Database, Shard | Number of expired objects per second (An expired object is an object with expired TTL that was deleted from the database) | This is more relevant for caching use cases.<br>Redis implements 2 expiry mechanisms:<br><br>1. Lazy expiry – on every access to an object Redis first checks whether the object has already been expired by looking at its TTL, and if ‘yes’ Redis deletes it<br><br>2. Active expiry – Redis constantly selects random keys and deletes them if it finds they were expired |
| Fork CPU usage | Database, Shard | CPU usage of Redis child forks (for replication, BGSAVA...) |  |
| Free disk space | Cluster, Node | Remaining unused disk space |  |
| Free ephemeral disk space | Cluster, Node | Remaining unused disk space on the ephemeral path |  |
| Free RAM | Cluster, Node | Remaining unused RAM memory |  |
| Hit ratio | Database, Shard | Calculated as number of ops on existing keys out of the total number of ops | `number_of_ops_on_exsiting_keys` / `total_ops` |
| Incoming traffic | Cluster, Node, Database | Total incoming traffic (in bytes/sec) to the database |  |
| Incoming traffic compressed | CRDB | Total incoming compressed traffic (in bytes/sec) to the database |  |
| Incoming traffic uncompressed | CRDB | Total incoming uncompressed traffic (in bytes/sec) to the database |  |
| Latency | Database | Latency per operation | The graph shows average, min, max and last values are also shown |
| Main Thread CPU usage | Database, Shard | Percent usage of the CPU by the main thread |  |
| Memory limit | Database | Memory size limit of the database, enforced on `used_memory` | **Note** – used memory does not include:<br>1. Fragmentation ratio<br>2. Replication buffer – it is `auto_slavebuf_ratio` % of `used_memory`.The default `auto_slavebuf_ratio` is 10%. And there is `auto_slavebuf_min` and `auto_slavebuf_max` which are `64MB` and `2048MB` by default, it will never exceed these in both directions.<br>3. Lua memory limit which has 2 thresholds:<br>  - A Garbage Collection threshold triggered when Lua memory crosses 0.5GB<br>  - A hard 1GB 1GB the Lua will never cross |
| Memory usage | Database | Calculated as used memory out of the memory limit | `used_memory` / `memory_limit` |
| Ops/sec | Cluster, Node, Database, Shard | Number of total operations per second | Where operations means:<br>1. read operations<br>2. write operations<br>3. other commands operations |
| Other cmds/sec | Database | Number of other commands per second | For example: PING, AUTH, INFO |
| Other commands latency | Database | Latency per other command | The graph shows average, min, max and last values are also shown |
| Outgoing traffic | Cluster, Node, Database | Total outgoing traffic (in bytes/sec) from the database |  |
| Pending writes max | CRDB | Maximum number of writes queued |  |
| Pending writes min | CRDB | Minimum number of writes queued |  |
| RAM fragmentation | Database, Shard | Ratio between the used (allocated) memory and the actual physical RAM that is used. |  |
| Read misses/sec | Database, Shard | Number of read operations (per sec) on non-existing keys | This metric is more relevant for caching use cases. |
| Reads latency | Database | Latency per read operation | The graph shows average, min, max and last values are also shown |
| Reads/sec | Database | Number of total reads per second | For example: GET |
| Total CPU usage | Database, Shard | Percent usage of the CPU |  |
| Total keys | Database, Shard | Total number of keys in the dataset (not including replication, even if replication enabled) | Calculated as the sum of all keys of all master shards. |
| Used memory | Database, Shard | Total memory used by the database, including RAM, Flash (if enabled) and replication (if enabled) | **Note** – used memory does not include:<br>1. The fragmentation overhead<br><br>2. The slave replication buffers at the masters<br><br>3. Memory used by Lua scripts<br><br>4. Copy On Write (COW) operation that can be triggered by:<br><br>  - A full replication process is started<br><br>  - A database snapshot process is started<br><br>  - AOF rewrite process is started |
| Write misses/sec | Database, Shard | Number of write operations (per sec) on non-existing keys | This metric is more relevant for caching use cases. |
| Writes latency | Database | Latency per write operation |  |
| Writes/sec | Database | Number of total writes per second | For example: SET |

## Redis on Flash Metrics

| Metric | Components measured | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  % Values in RAM | Database ROF, Shard ROF | Percentage of Total key count, for which values are stored in RAM |
|  Flash bytes/sec | Cluster ROF, Node ROF, Database ROF, Shard ROF | Read+write bytes per second on flash storage device |
|  Flash fragmentation | Database ROF, Shard ROF | Ratio between the (logical) used flash memory and the actual physical flash that is used |
|  Flash IOPS | Cluster ROF, Node ROF | Rate of I\O operations per second on flash storage device |
|  Flash KV ops | Node ROF | Rate of operations on flash key values (read + write + del) per second |
|  Flash ops/sec | Database ROF, Shard ROF | Rate of operations on flash key values (read + write + del) per second |
|  Free flash | Cluster ROF, Node ROF | Free space on flash storage |
|  RAM dataset overhead | Database ROF, Shard ROF | Percentage of the RAM limit that is used for anything other than values, such as key names, dictionaries and other overheads |
|  RAM hit ratio | Database ROF, Shard ROF | Calculated as: `requests_served_from_ram` / `total_requests`;<br/>Where:<br/>1. requests_served_from_ram – refers to all requests processed values directly from RAM (that is without touching the Flash)<br/>2. total_requests – refers to all requests processed by the database |
|  RAM limit | Database ROF | RAM limit in bytes |
|  RAM usage | Database ROF | Percentage of the RAM limit usage, calculated as: `used_ram` / `ram_limit` |
|  RAM:Flash access ratio | Database ROF, Shard ROF | Ratio between logical redis key value operations, and actual flash key value operations (regardless of what triggered these operations, that is including ram eviction and other background tasks) |
|  Used Flash | Database ROF, Shard ROF | Total RAM used to store values in Flash |
|  Used RAM | Database ROF, Shard ROF | Total size of data stored in RAM, including keys, values, overheads and including replication, if enabled |
|  Values in Flash | Database ROF, Shard ROF | Number of keys with values stored in Flash, not including replication |
|  Values in RAM | Database ROF, Shard ROF | Number of keys with values stored in RAM, not including replication |
| **What we can calculate and what we should know from the above** |  |  |
| Redis on Flash average key size (+ overhead) |  | Redis on Flash keeps all the keys and their overheads in RAM. Use the following steps to calculate the average size of a single key (including its overhead):<br>1. `total_keys_size` = `non_values_ram_overhead` * `used_ram`<br>2. `avg_key_size` = `total_keys_size` / (`total_keys` * 2) |
| Redis on Flash average value size, when the value is in RAM |  | Use following steps to calculate the average size of a value in RAM:<br>`total_size_of_values_in_ram` = (1 – `non_values_ram_overhead`) * `used_ram` `avg_value_size_in_ram` = `total_szie_of_values_in_ram` / (`values_in_ram` * 2) |
| Redis on Flash average value size, when the value is in Flash |  | This is calculated as: used_flash / values_in_flash<br>**Note** – Values in Flash are serialized and will always be smaller than in RAM |
| In Redis on Flash how come:<br>`value_in_ram` + `value_in_flash` > `total_keys` |  | Calculated as: `used_flash` / `flash_limit` |
