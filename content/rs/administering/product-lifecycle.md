## Release numbering

Redis Labs uses a four-place numbering scheme to designate released
versions of its products. The format is "Major1.Major2.Minor-Build"

- Major sections of the version number represent fundamental changes
    and additions in capabilities to Redis Enterprise Software. Major1
    or Major2 part of the version number is incremented based on the
    size and scale of the changes in each release.
- Minor section of the version number represents quality improvements
    and fixes to existing capabilities. We increment the minor number
    when many quality improvements are added to the release.
- Build number is incremented with any changes to the product. Build
    number is incremented with each build when any change is made to the
    binaries.

Redis Enterprise Software typically gets one major and one minor release
every year but the product ship cycles may vary.

## End-of-Life Schedule

End-of-Life for a given release occurs eighteen (18) months after the
