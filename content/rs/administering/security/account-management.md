## Creating users for use with LDAP authentication

To have a user authenticate with LDAP, you must have [LDAP integration
enabled]({{< relref "/rs/administering/security/ldap-integration.md" >}}),
and then create a new user via the REST API call like this:

```src
curl -k -L -v -u ":" --location-trusted -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://:8080/v1/users -d "{\"auth_method\": \"external\", \"name\": \"\", \"role\": \"\"}"
```

For the user-role, put in one of the following roles:

- admin
- cluster_member
- db_viewer
- db_member
- cluster_viewer

**Note**: At this time, there is no way to convert an existing account
to use LDAP. You must delete the existing and create a new account to
use.
