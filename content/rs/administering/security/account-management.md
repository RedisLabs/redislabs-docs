3.  Select which Role the user should have
4.  Indicate whether the user will receive email alerts.

## Updating a User

**To update a user:**

1.  Click the **Edit** icon at the far right of the user row.
2.  Edit the user details or delete the user.

## Creating users for use with LDAP authentication

To have a user authenticate with LDAP, you must have [LDAP integration
enabled]({{< relref "/rs/administering/security/ldap-integration.md" >}}),
and then create a new user via the REST API call like this:

``` {style="border: 2px solid #ddd; background-color: #333; color: #fff; padding: 10px; -webkit-font-smoothing: auto;"}
$ curl -k -L -v -u ":" --location-trusted -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
-X POST  http://:8080/v1/users 
-d "{\"auth_method\": \"external\", \"name\": \"\", \"role\": \"\"}"
```

For the user-role, put in one of the following roles:

-   admin
-   cluster\_member
-   db\_viewer
-   db\_member
-   cluster\_viewer

**Note**: At this time, there is no way to convert an existing account
to use LDAP. You must delete the existing and create a new account to
use.
