    1. Unarchive the rlec_docs.tar.gz package.
    1. Open the `rlec_docs\html\index.html` file in a web browser.
- Open the HTML files in an installed RS node:
    1. Connect to the terminal of an RS node.
    1. Change directory to the installation directory of RS, for example `/opt`.
    1. Copy the rlec_rest_api.tar.gz package to a host with a web browser and unarchive it.
    1. Open the `rlec_docs\html\index.html` file in a web browser.
