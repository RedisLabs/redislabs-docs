This section covers everything you need to know to run your Redis Enterprise Software deployment.

In addition to using the RS admin console to manage the cluster,
you can also do cluster operations with the cluster REST API.

To access the cluster REST API documentation, either:

- Open the HTML files in the RS software package:
    1. Download the RS software package.
    1. Unarchive the package.
    1. Unarchive the rlec_docs.tar.gz package.
    1. Open the `rlec_docs\html\index.html` file in a web browser.
- Open the HTML files in an installed RS node:
    1. Connect to the terminal of an RS node.
    1. Change directory to the Redis Enterprise Software installation directory, for example `/opt`.
    1. Copy the rlec_rest_api.tar.gz package to a host with a web browser and unarchive it.
    1. Open the `rlec_docs\html\index.html` file in a web browser.
