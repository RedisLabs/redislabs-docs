Here are explanations of some of the terms used in Redis Enterprise Software (RS).

## Node

A node is a physical machine, virtual machine, container or cloud
instance on which the RS installation package was installed and the
setup process was run in order to make the machine part of the cluster.

Each node is a container for running multiple open source Redis
instances, referred to as "shards".

The recommended configuration for a production cluster is an uneven
number of nodes, with a minimum of three. Note that in some
configurations, certain functionalities might be blocked. For example,
if a cluster has only one node you cannot enable database replication,
which helps to achieve high availability.

A node is made up of several components, as detailed below, and works
together with the other cluster nodes.

## Redis instance (shard)

As indicated above, each node serves as a container for hosting multiple
database instances, referred to as "shards".

RS supports various database configurations:

- **Standard Redis database** - A single Redis shard with no
    replication or data sharding.
- **Highly available Redis database** - Every database master shard
    has a replicated slave shard, so that if the master shard fails the
    cluster can automatically failover to the slave shard with minimal
    to no impact. Master and slave shards are always placed on separate
    nodes to ensure high availability.
- **Clustered Redis database** - The data stored in the database is
    split across several shards. The number of shards can be defined by
    the user. Various performance optimization algorithms define where
    shards are placed within the cluster. During the lifetime of the
    cluster, these algorithms might migrate a shard between nodes.
- **Clustered and highly available Redis database** - Each master shard
    in the clustered database has a slave shard, enabling failover if
    the master shard fails.

## Proxy

Each node includes one zero-latency, multi-threaded proxy
(written in low-level C) that masks the underlying system complexity. The
proxy oversees forwarding Redis operations to the database shards on
behalf of a Redis client.

The proxy simplifies the cluster operation, from the application or
Redis client point of view, by enabling the use of a standard Redis
client. The zero-latency proxy is built over a cut-through architecture
and employs various optimization methods. For example, to help ensure
high-throughput and low-latency performance, the proxy might use
instruction pipelining even if not instructed to do so by the client.

## Database endpoint

Each database is served by a database endpoint that is part of and
managed by the proxies. The endpoint oversees forwarding Redis
operations to specific database shards.

If the master shard fails and the slave shard is promoted to master, the
master endpoint is updated to point to the new master shard.

If the master endpoint fails, the slave endpoint is promoted to be the
new master endpoint and is updated to point to the master shard.

Similarly, if both the master shard and the master endpoint fail, then
both the slave shard and the slave endpoint are promoted to be the new
master shard and master endpoint.

As can be understood from the above, a shard and its endpoint do not
have to reside within the same node in the cluster.

In the case of a clustered database with multiple database shards, only
one master endpoint acts as the master endpoint for all master shards,
forwarding Redis operations to all shards as needed.

## Cluster manager

The cluster manager oversees all node management-related tasks, and the
cluster manager in the master node looks after all the cluster related
tasks.

The cluster manager is designed in a way that is totally decoupled from
the Redis operation. This enables RS to react in a much faster and
accurate manner to failure events, so that, for example, a node failure
event triggers mass failover operations of all the master endpoints
and master shards that are hosted on the failed node.

In addition, this architecture guarantees that each Redis shard is only
dealing with processing Redis commands in a shared-nothing architecture,
thus maintaining the inherent high-throughput and low-latency of each
Redis process. Lastly, this architecture guarantees that any change in
the cluster manager itself does not affect the Redis operation.

Some of the primary functionalities of the cluster manager include:

- Deciding where shards are created
- Deciding when shards are migrated and to where
- Monitoring database size
- Monitoring databases and endpoints across all nodes
- Running the database resharding process
- Running the database provisioning and de-provisioning processes
- Gathering operational statistics
- Enforcing license and subscription limitations

## Management UI

Each node runs a web server that is used to provide the user with access
to the management user interface (UI). The management UI allows viewing
and managing the entire cluster, so it does not matter which node is
used for accessing the UI.

## REST API

Each node exposes a REST API to the cluster. Using the REST API, you can
automate various tasks that are managed through the management UI. For
example, using the REST API you can instruct the cluster to create a new
database, update an existing database, or fetch various statistics.
