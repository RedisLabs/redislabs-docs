Redis on Flash (RoF) offers users of [Redis Enterprise
Software]({{< relref "/rs/_index.md" >}}) and [Redis
Enterprise Cloud](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/) the unique ability to
have very large Redis databases but at significant cost savings. Where
standard Redis databases must all be in RAM, Redis on Flash enables your
Redis databases to span both RAM and dedicated flash memory
(SSD). Whilst keys are always stored in RAM, RoF intelligently manages
the location of their values (RAM vs Flash) in the database via a
LRU-based (least-recently-used) mechanism. Hot values are stored in RAM,
but infrequently used, or warm values, are ejected to flash memory.
This enables you to have much larger datasets with RAM-like latency and
performance, but at dramatically lower cost than an all-RAM database.

By using Redis on Flash to distribute the data between RAM and flash
memory, which is much cheaper than RAM, you can lower your TCO and
better utilize hardware, hypervisor, and cloud resources. In many cases,
Redis on Flash can cut resource costs by over 70% when compared to an
all-RAM Redis Enterprise Software deployment.

## Flash Memory

Unlike standard Redis Enterprise Software installations, implementing
Redis on Flash requires pre-planning around memory and overall sizing.
There are a few critical recommendations

- The flash memory should be local to the server/VM/instance/container
    as opposed to network attached.
- The flash memory should be dedicated to RoF and not shared with other
    parts of the database, (e.g. durability, binaries, etc.).
- The flash memory should be [NVMe
    based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express) for best
    performance.

For more information read [Ephemeral and Persistent Storage in Redis
Enterprise
Software]({{< relref "/rs/administering/designing-production/persistent-ephemeral-storage.md" >}}).

When running on a cloud environment, the flash memory for Redis on Flash
should be on the ephemeral SSDs of the cloud instance and persistent
database storage should be network attached, e.g AWS EBS. For AWS, we
specifically recommend "[Storage Optimized I3 - High I/O
Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#storage-optimized)"
because of the performance of NVMe for flash memory.

When running RoF on-premise, it is best to use local internal flash
memory in each server (preferably NVMe SSDs for their exceptional
performance). The Redis Enterprise Software database persistent and
ephemeral storage can be on different disks, either local or attached.

When you begin planning the deployment of Redis on Flash in Production,
we recommend working closely with the Redis Labs technical team for
sizing and performance tuning.

## Tunable RAM to Flash Ratio

You can easily configure or tune the ratio of RAM-to-Flash for each
database independently, optimizing performance for your specific use
case. This is an online operation requiring no downtime for your
database. Think of this like a gas pedal in a car, the database speeds
up as you give it more gas (RAM). We recommend you keep at least 20% of
all values in RAM.

## Working Set Management

Of your dataset, perhaps there is a subset of highly active objects
considered the application's "working set." Redis on Flash 
intelligently manages the location of the working set (RAM) and the
infrequently accessed keys (flash memory), based on LRU
(least-recently-used) on a per-object basis.

## Redis Client Support

Just like all-RAM databases, RoF is compatible with existing Redis
applications. Databases that employ RoF are identical to all-RAM Redis
Enterprise Software databases in characteristics and features.

## Redis on Flash vs Disk Based Databases

Flash memory can be SATA or NVMe based storage devices, but NVMe is
where you can see the performance benefits. There are many databases in
the industry that are disk based. Disk-based databases use RAM to cache
part of the data for fast access. However, this approach is different
than extending RAM in a number of ways.

- Hot Value Handling: In many applications, a large portion of
    operations utilize only a subset of keys in the database. For
    example, the same keys may receive multiple writes repeatedly in a
    short amount of time. Under these conditions, disk-based databases
    have to repeatedly do I/O to save the updates to disk. In contrast,
    with RoF, the hot values stay in RAM and repeated writes to the same
    key do not generate IO to the flash memory.
- Write Performance: With pure disk-based databases, the writes to the
    disk have to be durable. To ensure durable writes, disk-based
    databases use techniques like WAL (write-ahead log) or Redo-Logs. In
    contrast, when RoF ejects a value from RAM to Flash, the write
    operation does not incur the expensive WAL or Redo log techniques.
    In other words, write amplification with durable writes is much
    slower than writes RoF performs to extend RAM. That said, you can
    still do durable writes with RoF, but there are some considerations.
- Future Proof: In recent years, with the emergence of persistent
    memory technologies, memory has been moving to converge with
    storage. Persisted memory technologies like [3D
    XPoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_XPoint) are good examples
    of these technologies. These technologies assume that your
    application is aware of which parts of the dataset should be kept in
    RAM and which part is OK to store in persistent memory. If your
    application is not specifically designed for this technology,
    persistent-memory performance is going to be very slow and perhaps
    unpredictable. Redis on Flash, in contrast, is application
    agnostic as it performs this function on the server side and your
    application has no need to understand where the data resides. Your
    application issues the same commands it always has with Redis and
    Redis Enterprise Software. You get the benefits of RoF now and into
    the future regardless of how flash memory evolves.

## Next Steps

To create Redis on Flash databases you must meet the following
prerequisites:

- Have ephemeral and persistent flash memory mounted on Redis
    Enterprise Software nodes with the proper disk size, per the [Redis
    on Flash memory
    guidelines]({{< relref "/rs/administering/designing-production/hardware-requirements.md#production-environment-hardware-requirements" >}}).
- Have all [hardware
    requirements]({{< relref "/rs/administering/designing-production/hardware-requirements.md" >}})
    in place.
- Have all [software
    requirements]({{< relref "/rs/installing-upgrading/supported-platforms.md" >}})
    in place.
- Perform the [initial setup and creation of a new
    cluster]({{< relref "/rs/installing-upgrading/_index.md" >}}).

Once these requirements are met, both Redis of Flash databases and
all-RAM databases can be created and managed in the same cluster. For
additional details, refer to [Creating a new
database]({{< relref "/rs/administering/database-operations/creating-database.md" >}}).

When Redis on Flash is enabled, additional settings and
[metrics]({{< relref "/rs/administering/monitoring-metrics/definitions.md#redis-on-flash-metrics" >}})
are available in the system.
