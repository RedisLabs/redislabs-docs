A Redis Enterprise cluster is composed of identical nodes that are
deployed within a data center or stretched across local availability
zones. Redis Enterprise architecture is made up of a management path
(shown in the blue layer in Figure 1 below) and data access path
(shown in the red layer in Figure 1 below).

- Management path includes the cluster manager, proxy and secure REST
    API/UI for programmatic administration. In short, cluster manager is
    responsible for orchestrating the cluster, placement of database
    shards as well as detecting and mitigating failures. Proxy helps
    scale connection management.
- Data Access path is composed of master and slave Redis shards.
    Clients perform data operations on the master shard. Master shards
    maintain slave shards using the in-memory replication for protection
    against failures that may render master shard inaccessible.

## High availability with Redis Enterprise

Redis Enterprise uses in-memory replication to maintain master and slave
replicas. Redis Enterprise comes with various watchdogs that detect and
protect against many failures types. Under failures such as node,
network, process failures that render master replica inaccessible, Redis
Enterprise automatically promotes the slave replica to be a master
replica and redirects the client connection transparently to the new
master replica.

Besides the intra-cluster replication, Redis Enterprise also has
built-in WAN-based replication for Redis deployments across multiple
data centers. WAN-based replication mechanisms in Redis Enterprise are
designed, protect against total Data Center or wider network failures.

## Scaling databases

Each Redis Enterprise cluster can contain multiple databases. In Redis,
databases represent data that belong to a single application, tenant, or
microservice. Redis Enterprise is built to scale to 100s of databases
per cluster to provide flexible and efficient multi-tenancy models.

Each database can contain few or many Redis shards. Sharding is
transparent to Redis applications. Master shards in the database process
data operations for a given subset of keys. The number of shards per
database is configurable and depend on the throughput needs of the
applications. Databases in Redis Enterprise can be resharded into more
Redis shards to scale throughput while maintaining sub-millisecond
latencies. Resharding is performed without downtime.

*Figure 2*
*Redis Enterprise places master (M) and slave (S) replicas in separate
nodes, racks and zones and use in-memory replication to protect data
against failures.*

In Redis Enterprise, each database has a quota of RAM. The quota cannot
exceed the limits of the RAM available on the node. However, with Redis
Enterprise Flash, RAM is extended to the local flash drive (SATA, NVMe
SSDs etc). The total quota of the database can take advantage of both
RAM and Flash drive. The administrator can choose the RAM vs Flash ratio
and adjust that anytime in the lifetime of the database without
downtime.

With Redis on Flash, instead of storing all keys and data for a
given shard in RAM, less frequently accessed values are pushed to flash.
If applications need to access a value that is in flash, Redis
Enterprise automatically brings the value into RAM. Depending on the
flash hardware in use, applications experience slightly higher latency
when bringing values back into RAM from flash. However subsequent
accesses to the same value is fast, once the value is in RAM.

## Data durability with Redis Enterprise

Redis Enterprise has two durability options:

- Disk-based durability: Redis Enterprise still maintains a durable
    copy on disk. Just like disk-based systems, this IO path is placed
    on a slower and durable network-attached storage device. Redis
    databases provide tunable options to maintain this durable copy and
    keep it up to date with frequent periodic writes all the way to
    every write operation.
- Replication-based durability: Redis Enterprise also maintains a
    replica, a slave shard, for durability. This replicated durability
    protects against node, rack, or zone failures. Replicated-durability
    provides better write performance over network-attached storage
    writes. This means under an unplanned interruption, it is more
    likely that your replica is more up to date as compared to your
    durable copy on disk. To take full advantage of the
    replicated-durability, Redis provides the WAIT command. WAIT makes sure that
    a write can wait for acknowledgment until multiple replicas
    confirm that write. This makes sure that a write confirmed with WAIT on
    replicas are durable even if a node catches on fire and never
    comes back to the cluster.
