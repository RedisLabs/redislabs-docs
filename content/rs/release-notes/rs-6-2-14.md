## Features and enhancements

### Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) 

OCSP verifies the status of a certificate maintained by a third-party certificate authority (CA).  Redis Enterprise v6.2.14 uses OCSP stapling to validate the server proxy certificate.  
    
When OSCP stapling is enabled, Redis Enterprise regularly polls the CA OCSP responder, which responds by indicating that the certificate is valid, revoked, or unknown.  The response is cached until the polling event; it's used during TLS handshakes.   
    
The setting the controls OCSP stapling can be found on the **Settings** | **OCSP** tab of the admin console.

### Private key encryption

Redis Enterprise Software v6.2.14 supports private key encryption.  When private key encryption is enabled, Redis Enterprise generates (and securely stores) private keys for each node on the cluster.

### User security settings in admin console

Starting with v6.2.14, the admin console includes user security settings that control password complexity rules, password expiration, and session timeout.  

These settings are available from the **Settings** | **Preferences** tab of the admin console.

## Security

### Open source Redis security compatibility

As part of Redis commitment to security, Redis Enterprise Software implements the latest [security fixes](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) available with open source Redis. 

The following [Open Source Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis) [CVEs](https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories) do not affect Redis Enterprise:

- [CVE-2021-32625](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32625) - Redis Enterprise is not impacted by the CVE that was found and fixed in open source Redis since Redis Enterprise does not implement LCS. Additional information about the open source Redis fix is on [the Redis GitHub page](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) (Redis 6.2.4, Redis 6.0.14)

- [CVE-2021-32672](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32672) - Redis Enterprise is not impacted by the CVE that was found and fixed in open source Redis because the LUA debugger is unsupported in Redis Enterprise. Additional information about the open source Redis fix is on [the Redis GitHub page](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) (Redis 6.2.6, Redis 6.0.16)

- [CVE-2021-32675](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32675) - Redis Enterprise is not impacted by the CVE that was found and fixed in open source Redis because the proxy in Redis Enterprise does not forward unauthenticated requests. Additional information about the open source Redis fix is on [the Redis GitHub page](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) (Redis 6.2.6, Redis 6.0.16)

- [CVE-2021-32762](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32762) - Redis Enterprise is not impacted by the CVE that was found and fixed in open source Redis because the memory allocator used in Redis Enterprise is not vulnerable. Additional information about the open source Redis fix is on [the Redis GitHub page](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) (Redis 6.2.6, Redis 6.0.16)

- [CVE-2021-41099](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41099) - Redis Enterprise is not impacted by the CVE that was found and fixed in open source Redis because the proto-max-bulk-len CONFIG is blocked in Redis Enterprise. Additional information about the open source Redis fix is on [the Redis GitHub page](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) (Redis 6.2.6, Redis 6.0.16) security fixes for [recent CVEs](https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories). 

Redis Enterprise has already included the fixes for the relevant CVEs. 

Some CVEs announced for open source Redis do not affect Redis Enterprise due to different and additional functionality available in Redis Enterprise that is not available in open source Redis.
