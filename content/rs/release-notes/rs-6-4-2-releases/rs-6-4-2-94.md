## New features and enhancements

- RS98361 - Enhanced the algorithm responsible for placing shards in the cluster. This improvement applies when creating new databases and when calling the REST API `GET optimize_shards_placement` for existing databases.

With this update, the algorithm efficiently finds a legal placement while reducing the calculation time significantly. These changes ensure a smoother and faster experience when managing databases with a large number of shards and dense shard placement policy.

- RS62197 - Added validation of the operating system (OS) version before installation. The installer automatically validates the OS type and version and verifies the correct binary is used for the corresponding system. This prevents missing dependencies which may cause issues later on.

The validation applies to major versions of all operating systems. If the check fails, the installation process halts with an appropriate error message.
