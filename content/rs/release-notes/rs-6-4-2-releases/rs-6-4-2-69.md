## Version changes

### Deprecations

#### watchdog_profile

The `watchdog_profile` setting is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Instead, use the `failure_detection_sensitivity` policy for predefined thresholds and timeouts:

```sh
rladmin tune cluster failure_detection_sensitivity [ high | low ]
```

The `failure_detection_sensitivity` policy has the following options:

- `high` (previously known as `local-network watchdog_profile`) – high failure detection sensitivity, lower thresholds, and faster failure detection and failover

- `low` (previously known as `cloud watchdog_profile`) – low failure detection sensitivity and higher tolerance for latency variance (also called network jitter)

#### Ubuntu 16.04

Ubuntu 16 support is deprecated, and support will be removed in a future release.

#### Active-Active database persistence

The RDB snapshot option for [Active-Active database persistence]({{<relref "/rs/databases/active-active/manage#data-persistence">}}) is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Please plan to reconfigure any Active-Active databases to use append-only file (AOF) persistence with the following command:

```sh
crdb-cli crdb update --crdb-guid <CRDB_GUID> \
    --default-db-config '{"data_persistence": "aof", "aof_policy":"appendfsync-every-sec"}'
```

## Resolved issues

- RS97528 - Prevent [self-signed certificate]({{<relref "/rs/security/certificates/create-certificates">}}) script error on Ubuntu 20.04 by changing the user instructions.

- RS99643 - Fix [`cipher_suites`]({{<relref "/rs/security/encryption/tls/ciphers">}}) configuration to allow default cipher suites according to the [control plane]({{<relref "/rs/security/encryption/tls/ciphers#control-plane">}}), [data plane]({{<relref "/rs/security/encryption/tls/ciphers#data-plane">}}), and [discovery service]({{<relref "/rs/security/encryption/tls/ciphers#discovery-service">}}).

- RS99696 - Fix  [`HINCRBYFLOT`](https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-hjv8-vjf6-wcr6) CVE

- RS54226 - During upgrades, a CRDB worker process would intermittently get stuck in a restart loop. This issue is now fixed. 

## Known limitations

### Feature limitations

- RS78430 -  When [tuning module arguments]({{<relref "/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/tune#tune-db">}}), any typo or use of unsupported arguments can cause shards to get stuck after restart.

### Operating system limitations

#### Ubuntu 20.04

By default, you cannot use the SHA1 hash algorithm ([OpenSSL’s default security level is set to 2](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.3ssl.html#notes)). The operating system will reject SHA1 certificates even if the `mtls_allow_weak_hashing` option is enabled. You need to replace SHA1 certificates with newer certificates that use SHA-256. Note that the certificates provided with Redis Enterprise Software use SHA-256.
