## Known limitations

#### Command limitations

- [`CLIENT NO-TOUCH`](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) might not run correctly in the following cases:

    - The Redis database version is earlier than 7.2.0.

    - The `CLIENT NO-TOUCH` command is forbidden by ACL rules.

    Before sending this command, clients should verify the database version is 7.2.0 or later and that using this command is allowed. 

- You cannot use [`SUNSUBSCRIBE`](https://redis.io/commands/sunsubscribe/) to unsubscribe from a shard channel if the regex changed while subscribed.

- Using [`XREADGROUP BLOCK`](https://redis.io/commands/xreadgroup/) with `>` to return all new streams will cause the Redis database to freeze until the shard is restarted. ([#12031](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12301))

- Because a rejected command does not record the duration for command stats, an error will appear after it is reprocessed that will cause the Redis database to freeze until the shard is restarted. ([#12247](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12247))

#### Modules cannot load in Oracle Linux 7 & 8

Databases hosted on Oracle Linux 7 & 8 cannot load modules.

As a temporary workaround, you can change the node's `os_name` in the Cluster Configuration Store (CCS):

```sh
ccs-cli hset node:<ID> os_name rhel7
```
