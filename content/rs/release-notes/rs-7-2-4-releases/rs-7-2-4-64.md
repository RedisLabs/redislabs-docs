This is a maintenance release for ​[​Redis Enterprise Software version 7.2.4](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/download-center/software/).

## Highlights

This version offers:

- Improved cluster recovery with manually uploaded modules

- Support package enhancements

- Configurable port range

- License API enhancements

## New in this release

### Enhancements

- Cluster recovery with manually uploaded modules 

    - For clusters containing databases with manually uploaded modules, [cluster recovery]({{<relref "/rs/clusters/cluster-recovery">}}) is now seamlessly integrated.

- Support package now contains `supervisorctl` status when created by the [`rladmin` command]({{<relref "/rs/installing-upgrading/creating-support-package#command-line-method">}}) (RS107879).

- Port range (`reserved_ports`) is now configurable using [`rladmin`]({{<relref "/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/cluster/config">}}) or the [REST API]({{<relref "/rs/references/rest-api/requests/cluster">}}).

    - Removed `rlutil reserved_ports`, which was deprecated in Redis Enterprise Software [version 7.2.4-52]({{<relref "/rs/release-notes/rs-7-2-4-releases/rs-7-2-4-52#api-deprecations">}}).

- [License REST API requests]({{<relref "/rs/references/rest-api/requests/license">}}) return the number of used shards (RAM & flash).

#### Redis modules

Redis Enterprise Software version 7.2.4-64 includes the following Redis Stack modules (no changes since [Redis Enterprise Software version 7.2.4-52]({{<relref "/rs/release-notes/rs-7-2-4-releases/rs-7-2-4-52">}}):

- [RediSearch 2.8.4](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/releases/tag/v2.8.4)

- [RedisJSON 2.6.6](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/releases/tag/v2.6.6)

- [RedisTimeSeries 1.10.4](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/releases/tag/v1.10.4)

- [RedisBloom 2.6.3](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/releases/tag/v2.6.3)

- [RedisGears 2.0.11](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/releases/tag/v2.0.11-m12)

### Resolved issues

- RS107986 - Allow ports lower than 1024 when configuring [auditing]({{<relref "/rs/security/audit-events">}}) using `rladmin`.

- RS105335 - Added error handling to [`CLIENT NO-TOUCH`](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) to return an error if the Redis database version is earlier than 7.2.0 or the command is restricted by ACL rules (handles `CLIENT NO-TOUCH` [command limitations](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/release-notes/rs-7-2-4-releases/rs-7-2-4-52/#command-limitations)).

- RS105137 - Fixed audit reconnect issue: sometimes the proxy failed to reconnect to a restarted audit listener.

- RS108394 - Added API validation to prevent configuring Replica Of with TLS without providing a server certificate.

- RS108233 - Proceed with the upgrade even if an empty `saslauthd` configuration exists.

- RS107730 - Fixed a bug where the `failed_authentication_attempt` event log always contained 127.0.0.1 instead of the real client IP address.

- RS107727 - Fixed permission issue for `/etc/cron.d/redislabs` file in Red Hat.

- RS108230 - Removed unused test certificate and key files from the `redis-enterprise` package.

- RS107718 - When `cm_server` is disabled through `optional_services`, envoy (the cluster’s reverse proxy) now stops listening on the `cm_server` port.

- RS107909 - Added `os_family`, which groups operating systems into categories, to node properties and upgrade logic. Fixed the [known limitation]({{<relref "/rs/release-notes/rs-7-2-4-releases#modules-cannot-load-in-oracle-linux-7--8">}}) for upgrades and module uploads for the following operating systems: Rocky Linux, Oracle Linux 7, Oracle Linux 8, CentOS 7, and CentOS 8.

## Security

#### Open source Redis security fixes compatibility

As part of Redis's commitment to security, Redis Enterprise Software implements the latest [security fixes](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) available with [open source Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis). The following open source Redis [CVEs](https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories) do not affect Redis Enterprise:

- [CVE-2021-32625](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32625) — Redis Enterprise is not impacted by the CVE that was found and fixed in open source Redis since Redis Enterprise does not implement LCS. Additional information about the open source Redis fix is on the [Redis GitHub page](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) (Redis 6.2.4, Redis 6.0.14)

- [CVE-2021-32672](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32672) — Redis Enterprise is not impacted by the CVE that was found and fixed in open source Redis because the LUA debugger is unsupported in Redis Enterprise. Additional information about the open source Redis fix is on the [Redis GitHub page](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) (Redis 6.2.6, Redis 6.0.16)

- [CVE-2021-32675](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32675) — Redis Enterprise is not impacted by the CVE that was found and fixed in open source Redis because the proxy in Redis Enterprise does not forward unauthenticated requests. Additional information about the open source Redis fix is on the [Redis GitHub page](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) (Redis 6.2.6, Redis 6.0.16)

- [CVE-2021-32762](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32762) — Redis Enterprise is not impacted by the CVE that was found and fixed in open source Redis because the memory allocator used in Redis Enterprise is not vulnerable. Additional information about the open source Redis fix is on the [Redis GitHub page](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) (Redis 6.2.6, Redis 6.0.16)

- [CVE-2021-41099](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41099) — Redis Enterprise is not impacted by the CVE that was found and fixed in open source Redis because the `proto-max-bulk-len CONFIG` is blocked in Redis Enterprise. Additional information about the open source Redis fix is on the [Redis GitHub page](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) (Redis 6.2.6, Redis 6.0.16)

Redis Enterprise has already included the fixes for the relevant CVEs. Some CVEs announced for open source Redis do not affect Redis Enterprise due to different and additional functionality available in Redis Enterprise that is not available in open source Redis.
