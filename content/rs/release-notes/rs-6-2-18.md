### New features and enhancements

#### General Availability of Active-Active databases with RedisJSON

Active-Active databases now support Index, query, and full-text search of nested JSON documents when combining RedisJSON with RediSearch.

#### Database connection auditing

You can now [audit database connection]({{<relref "/rs/security/audit-events">}}) and authentication events to track and troubleshoot activity.  Administrators can now use third-party systems to track and analyze connection events in realtime.  

#### Private key encryption

When enabled, private key encryption encrypts private keys stored in the cluster configuration store (CCS).  Private keys are encrypted using a secure, self-contained internal process.  Databases must be at least version 6.2.2 or later to use this feature.

#### Active-Active support for MEMORY USAGE command

Redis Enterprise Active-Active databases now support the [MEMORY USAGE](https://redis.io/commands/memory-usage/) command, which simplifies troubleshooting and lets applications detect anomalous behavior and dangerous trends.
To learn more, see  [`Active-Active with RedisJSON`]({{<relref "/modules/redisjson/active-active">}}).

MEMORY USAGE reports the RAM memory use, in bytes, of a key and its value.  The result includes the memory allocated for the data value and the administrative overhead associated with the key.

#### `crdb-cli` improvements

The `crdb-cli` utility used to manage Active-Active databases now allows greater visibility into management operations to make it easier to investigate and troubleshoot problems. You can now use:

- `crdb-cli task list` to retrieve details about current and previous tasks for all Active-Active databases on a cluster

- `crdb-cli task --task-id <task-id>` to get detailed information about a specific task.

To learn more, see [`crdb-cli`]({{<relref "/rs/references/cli-utilities/crdb-cli">}})

#### Redis modules 

Redis Enterprise Software v6.2.18-43 (September release) includes the following Redis modules:

- [RediSearch v2.4.11](https://docs.redis.com/latest/modules/redisearch/release-notes/redisearch-2.4-release-notes/#v2411-july-2022)
- [RedisJSON v2.2.0](https://docs.redis.com/latest/modules/redisjson/release-notes/redisjson-2.2-release-notes/#v220-july-2022)
- [RedisBloom v2.2.18](https://docs.redis.com/latest/modules/redisbloom/release-notes/redisbloom-2.2-release-notes/#v2218-july-2022)
- [RedisGraph v2.8.17](https://docs.redis.com/latest/modules/redisgraph/release-notes/redisgraph-2.8-release-notes/#v2817-july-2022)
- [RedisTimeSeries v1.6.17](https://docs.redis.com/latest/modules/redistimeseries/release-notes/redistimeseries-1.6-release-notes/#v1617-july-2022)

See [Upgrade modules](https://docs.redis.com/latest/modules/install/upgrade-module/) to learn how to upgrade a module for a database. 

#### Additional enhancements

- Added support for the MODULE LIST command on Active-Active databases
- Enhanced validity checks of the input parameters of the CRDB-CLI tool
- The Syncer lag calculation has been improved and fixes multiple miscalculations
- Support package includes additional information for Active-Active databases
- Added the ability to retrieve the syncer mode (centralized / distributed) by running   

    `rladmin info db [{db:<id> | <name>}]`  

    To learn more, see [Distributed sychronization]({{<relref "/rs/databases/active-active/synchronization-mode">}})   

### Version changes 

#### Breaking changes

RS84006 - When using the REST API to create a database, this specific set of conditions can lead to an error:

- sharding is enabled
- oss_sharding and implicit_shard_key are both deactivated
- A shard_key_regex is _not_ defined

If this occurs, the database endpoint returns `(error) ERR key "test" does not match any rule`.

To address this issue, do one of the following:

- Explicitly define shard_key_regex
- Enable oss_sharding or implicit_shard_key (enabling both also works) 


#### Prerequisites and notes 

-  You can [upgrade to v6.2.18](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/installing-upgrading/upgrading/) from Redis Enterprise Software v6.0 and later. 

- Refer to [v6.2.4 release notes](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/release-notes/rs-6-2-4-august-2021/) for important notes regarding changes made to the upgrade policy and how those changes might impact your experience. 

- Upgrades from versions earlier than v6.0 are not supported.

- If you plan to upgrade your cluster to RHEL 8, see the [v6.2.8 release notes](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/release-notes/rs-6-2-8-october-2021/) for known limitations.

#### Deprecation notice

##### Active-Active database persistence
The snapshot option for [data persistence on Active-Active databases](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/databases/active-active/manage/#data-persistence) will be deprecated in a future version of Redis Enterprise Software.  If you have an Active-Active database using snapshot persistence, we strongly encourage you to switch to AOF persistence.  Use `crdb-cli` to do so:
```text
crdb-cli crdb update --crdb-guid <CRDB_GUID> --default-db-config '{"data_persistence": "aof", "aof_policy":"appendfsync-every-sec"}'
```

##### TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 

TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 connections are considered deprecated in favor of TLS 1.2 or later.  

Please verify that all clients, apps, and connections support TLS 1.2.  Support for the earlier protocols will be removed in a future release.

Certain operating systems, such as RHEL 8, have already removed support for the earlier protocols.  Redis Enterprise Software cannot support connection protocols that are not supported by the underlying operating system.

##### 3DES encryption cipher

The 3DES encryption cipher is considered deprecated in favor of stronger ciphers like AES.

Please verify that all clients, apps, and connections support the AES cipher. Support for 3DES will be removed in a future release.

Certain operating systems, such as RHEL 8, have already removed support for 3DES. Redis Enterprise Software cannot support cipher suites that are not supported by the underlying operating system.

#### Product lifecycle updates 

Redis Enterprise Software v6.0.x reached end-of-life (EOL) on May 31, 2022.

EOL of Redis Enterprise Software 6.2.x was reset to occur 18 months after the release of version 6.4, in accordance with the updated EOL policy.  The new EOL date is August 31, 2024.

To learn more, see the Redis Enterprise Software [product lifecycle](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/administering/product-lifecycle/), which details the release number and the end-of-life schedule for Redis Enterprise Software.
