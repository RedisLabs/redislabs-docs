    [Active-Active](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/administering/creating-databases/create-active-active/)
    Redis databases.

    Redis database using the Active-Passive (Replica Of) mechanism.

-   Support for the [BITFIELD data type on Active-Active](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/references/developing-for-active-active/developing-strings-active-active/)
    Redis databases.

## New Features

#### New LDAP integration

Redis Enterprise Software integrates Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) authentication and authorization into its [role-based access controls]
(RBAC). You can now use LDAP to authorize access to the admin console and to
authorize database access.

#### Clients Mutual TLS authentication using a Certificate Authority (CA)

Redis Enterprise Software adds the ability to use a Certificate Authority (CA)
for client authentications, allowing clients to rotate their certificates
without the need to load new certificates to your database.

#### Redis eviction policies on Active-Active Redis databases

All [Redis eviction policies](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/administering/database-operations/eviction-policy/)
are now supported on Active-Active Redis databases. You can create new
Active-Active databases or edit existing ones using the UI console to enable it.

-   Note that eviction is not supported yet for Active-Active Redis databases
    running with Redis on Flash (Rof).

#### Migration to an Active-Active Redis database

Redis Enterprise Software adds the ability to easily [migrate your Redis
database to an Active-Active](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/administering/database-operations/migrate-to-active-active/)
Redis database using the Active-Passive (Replica Of) mechanism.

#### BITFIELD on Active-Active Redis databases

Redis Enterprise Software adds the ability to use the BITFIELD data type on
Active-Active Redis databases. Please read more about [developing for Active-Active with BITFIELD](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/references/developing-for-active-active/developing-strings-active-active/)
to understand the conflict resolution and limitations.

## Additional capabilities

-   Redis Software 6.0.20 includes open source Redis 6.0.9. For more information about Redis
    6.0.9, check out the [release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/6.0.9/00-RELEASENOTES).

-   Redis Software 6.0.20 adds new `rladmin` commands for setting Ciphers suites and minimal
    TLS version for:

    -   Control plane: setting Envoy

    -   Data plane: setting the Proxy for clients connections

    -   Sentinel discovery service

-   Starting with Redis Software 6.0.20, new clusters will be set with minimal TLS version v1.2


All known bugs around setting ciphers were fixed.  To learn more, see [Updating certificates](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/administering/cluster-operations/updating-certificates/#cipher-configuration).

-   Starting with Redis Software 6.0.20, the [syncer process](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/administering/designing-production/active-active/#syncer-process)
    was improved to automatically recover and resume synchronisation after
    reaching out-of-memory.

-   Envoy updated and verified with multiple security headers.

-   Starting with Redis Software 6.0.20:

    -   The replication backlog size of new databases is allocated dynamically according to shard size.

    -   The Active-Active replication backlog size of new Active-Active databases is allocated dynamically according to shard size.




## Important fixes

-   RS50905, RS54809, 54940 - Fix in Redis preventing missing process PID

-   RS54382 - Fixed missing API documentation

-   RS52433, RS53417, RS42195, RS42194, RS30526, RS46821, RS48928 - Fixed
    security headers for Envoy

-   RS55504 - Fixed a bug on Build #66 that cuased RediSearch cursor to break.

## Known limitations

#### Upgrade

-   [Redis Software 5.4.2](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/release-notes/rs-5-4-2-april-2019/)
    introduced new Active-Active Redis Database capabilities that improve its
    compatibility with open source Redis. Now the string data-type in
    Active-Active Redis Database is implicitly and dynamically typed, just like
    open source Redis. To use the new capabilities on nodes that are upgraded
    from version RS 5.4.2 or lower, you must 
    [upgrade the Active-Active Redis Database protocol](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/installing-upgrading/upgrading/#upgrading-crdbs).

-   When you upgrade an Active-Active Redis with active AOF from [Redis Software 5.4.2](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/release-notes/rs-5-4-2-april-2019/)
    or earlier to version [Redis Software 5.4.4](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/release-notes/rs-5-4-4-june-2019/)
    or later:

    -   If replication is enabled, you must run the BGREWRITEAOF command on all
        slave shards after the upgrade.

    -   If replication is not enabled, you must run the BGREWRITEAOF command on
        all shards after the upgrade.

-   Node upgrade fails if the SSL certificates were configured in version 5.0.2
    or above by manually updating the certificates on the disk instead of
    [updating them through the API](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/administering/cluster-operations/updating-certificates/).
    For help with this issue, contact Support.

-   Starting from [Redis Software 5.4.2](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/release-notes/rs-5-4-2-april-2019/),
    to preserve the current Redis major.minor version during database upgrade
    you must use the keep_redis_version option instead of keep_current_version.

#### Redis commands 

-   The capability of disabling specific Redis commands does not work on
    commands specific to Redis modules.

-   CLIENT UNBLOCK command is not supported in RS 5.4 and above

-   Starting from RS 5.4.2 and after upgrading the CRDB, TYPE commands for
    string data-type in CRDBs return "string" (OSS Redis standard).
