If you are upgrading from a previous version, make sure to review the
upgrade instructions before beginning the upgrade process.

You can upgrade to this version from any 4.4 version. If you have a
version older than 4.4 you must first upgrade to 4.4 or higher, and only
then upgrade to this version.

## New features

### The new discovery service with supportfor Redis Sentinel API

The Discovery Service provides an IP-based connection management service
used when connecting to Redis Enterprise Pack databases. When used in
conjunction with Redis Enterprise Pack's other high availability
features, the Discovery Service assists an application cope with
topology changes such as adding, removing of nodes, node failovers and
so on. It does this by providing your application with the ability to
easily discover which node hosts the database endpoint. The API used for
discovery service is compliant with the Redis Sentinel API.

Discovery Service is an alternative for applications that do not want to
depend on DNS name resolution for their connectivity. Discovery Service
and DNS based connectivity are not mutually exclusive. They can be used
side by side in a given cluster where some clients can use Discovery
Service based connection while others can use DNS name resolution when
connecting to databases.

### Building large databases with RAM and Flash memory in Redis on Flash v2.0

With Redis Enterprise Pack 4.5, Redis on Flash v2 is production
ready. RFv2 brings performance, reliability, and stability enhancements
as well as many features customers have been waiting for.

Redis on Flash (RoF) offers users of Redis Enterprise Pack and
Redis Enterprise Cloud Private the unique ability to operate a Redis
database that spans both RAM and flash memory (SSD), but remains
separate from Redis Enterprise Pack's persistence mechanisms. Whilst
keys are always stored in RAM, RoF intelligently manages the location of
their values (RAM vs Flash) in the database via a LRU-based
(least-recently-used) mechanism. Hot values will be in RAM and
infrequently used, while warm values will be ejected to flash memory.
This enables you to have much larger datasets with RAM-like latency and
performance, but at dramatically lower cost than an all-RAM database.

### Additional capabilities

Support for additional Redis commands and features:

- The Redis TOUCH command is now supported
- Redis version upgraded to 3.2.8
- Support for OBJECT in Lua scripts

Support has been added RHEL 7.3 with this version.
