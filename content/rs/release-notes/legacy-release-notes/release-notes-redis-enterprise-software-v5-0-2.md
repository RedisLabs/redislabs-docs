Redis Enterprise Software 5.0.2 is now available. Key features include
functional and performance updates for CRDB, changes to module
deployment, and general fixes.

## Overview

If you are upgrading from a previous version, make sure to review the
upgrade instructions before beginning the upgrade process.

You can upgrade to RS 5.0.2 from RS 4.4.2 and above. If you have a
version older than 4.4.2, you must first upgrade to at least 5.0.

{{< note >}}
Starting from RS 5.0.2, ports 3338 and 3339 should also be opened
on each node for the purpose of internal cluster communication.

configurations']({{< relref "/rs/administering/designing-production/networking/port-configurations.md" >}})

## Known limitations

- Since Redis Enterprise CRDBs have counters, unlike traditional Redis
    databases, they must be handled differently when importing. There is
    a special type of import because of importing counter data types.
    When performing the import through the web UI, you will be prompted
    to confirm you want to add the data to the CRDB or stop and go flush
    the database.
- This version of RS comes with a pre-bundled python which might
    over-ride your default installed python version, this can be solved
    by changing your PATH environment variable.
- Uploading a Redis Module through the Web UI, can be performed only
    when the Web UI is connected to the master node.
- Write operations are not allowed for database which was created with
    password of exactly 50-characters.
