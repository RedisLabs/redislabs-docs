## Deprecations

### Active-Active database persistence

The snapshot option for [data persistence on Active-Active databases](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/databases/active-active/manage/#data-persistence) will be deprecated in a future version of Redis Enterprise Software. If you have an Active-Active database using snapshot persistence, switch to AOF persistence. Use `crdb-cli` to do so:
```text
crdb-cli crdb update --crdb-guid <CRDB_GUID> --default-db-config '{"data_persistence": "aof", "aof_policy":"appendfsync-every-sec"}'
```

### TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 

TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 connections are considered deprecated in favor of TLS 1.2 or later.  

Please verify that all clients, apps, and connections support TLS 1.2.  Support for the earlier protocols will be removed in a future release.

Certain operating systems, such as RHEL 8, have removed support for the earlier protocols. Redis Enterprise Software does not support connection protocols that are not supported by the underlying operating system.

### 3DES encryption cipher

The 3DES encryption cipher is considered deprecated in favor of stronger ciphers like AES.

Please verify that all clients, apps, and connections support the AES cipher. Support for 3DES will be removed in a future release.

Certain operating systems, such as RHEL 8, have already removed support for 3DES. Redis Enterprise Software cannot support cipher suites that are not supported by the underlying operating system.

## Known limitations
    
### Feature limitations

- RS54131 Running the `QUIT` command on a TLS connected database closes connection and does not return a `+OK` reply

- An intermittent issue can occur where a CRDB process becomes stuck in a restart loop. If this issue occurs while upgrading to Redis Enterprise Software version 6.2.18, please upgrade to the latest version [6.4.2-69]({{<relref "/rs/release-notes/rs-6-4-2-releases/rs-6-4-2-69">}}) or [contact support](https://redis.com/company/support/).

- RS40641 - API requests are redirected to an internal IP in case the request arrives from a node which is not the master. To avoid this issue, use [`rladmin cluster config`]({{<relref "/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/cluster/config">}}) to configure `handle_redirects` or `handle_metrics_redirects`.

- RS51144, RS102128 - Active-Active: To start successfully, the syncer (`crdt-syncer`) must connect to all sources. In multi-cluster configurations (more than 2 A-A clusters participating), in some cases, if one or more of the clusters is not available, A-A replication will be down.

### Installation limitations

Several Redis Enterprise Software installation reference files are installed to the directory `/etc/opt/redislabs/` even if you use [custom installation directories]({{<relref "/rs/installing-upgrading/install/customize-install-directories">}}).

As a workaround to install Redis Enterprise Software without using any root directories, do the following before installing Redis Enterprise Software:

1. Create all custom, non-root directories you want to use with Redis Enterprise Software.

1. Mount `/etc/opt/redislabs` to one of the custom, non-root directories.

### Upgrade limitations

Before you upgrade a cluster that hosts Active-Active databases with modules to v6.2.18, perform the following steps:

1. Use `crdb-cli` to verify that the modules (`modules`) and their versions (in `module_list`) are as they appear in the database configuration and in the default database configuration:

    ```sh
    crdb-cli crdb get --crdb-guid <crdb-guid>
    ```

1. From the admin console's **redis modules** tab, validate that these modules with their specific versions are loaded to the cluster.

1. If one or more of the modules/versions are missing or if you need help, [contact Redis support](https://redis.com/company/support/) before taking additional steps.
