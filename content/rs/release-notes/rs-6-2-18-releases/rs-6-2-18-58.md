- [RediSearch v2.4.14](https://docs.redis.com/latest/modules/redisearch/release-notes/redisearch-2.4-release-notes/#v2414-august-2022)

See [Upgrade modules](https://docs.redis.com/latest/modules/install/upgrade-module/) to learn how to upgrade a module for a database. 

## Resolved issues

- RS85369 - Fixes umask validation during installation to allow for temporary umask change
- RS77339 - Fixes the “FROM” email addresses of email alerts
- RS86005 - Fixes  `bdbs/<int:uid>/actions/recover` API to return the bdb status and not the `recovery_plan`

## Known upgrade limitations

Before you upgrade a cluster that hosts Active-Active databases with modules to v6.2.18, perform the following steps:

1. Use `crdb-cli` to verify that the modules (`modules`) and their versions (in `module_list`) are as they appear in the database configuration and in the default database configuration:

    ```sh
    crdb-cli crdb get --crdb-guid <crdb-guid>
    ```

1. From the admin console's **redis modules** tab, validate that these modules with their specific versions are loaded to the cluster.

1. If one or more of the modules/versions are missing or if you need help, [contact Redis support](https://redis.com/company/support/) before taking additional steps.
