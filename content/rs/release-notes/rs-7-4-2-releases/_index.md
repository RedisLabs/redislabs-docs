## Version changes

### Deprecations

#### API deprecations

- The replica HA cluster policy is deprecated.

- The maintenance mode option `keep_slave_shards` is deprecated in `rladmin` and the REST API. Use `evict_ha_replica` and `evict_active_active_replica` instead.

- `/v1/debuginfo` REST API paths are deprecated. Use the new paths [`/v1/cluster/debuginfo`]({{<relref "/rs/references/rest-api/requests/cluster/debuginfo">}}), [`/v1/nodes/debuginfo`]({{<relref "/rs/references/rest-api/requests/nodes/debuginfo">}}), and [`/v1/bdbs/debuginfo`]({{<relref "/rs/references/rest-api/requests/bdbs/debuginfo">}}) instead.

#### Legacy UI deprecation

The legacy UI is deprecated in favor of the new Cluster Manager UI and will be removed in a future release.

#### Redis 6.0 database deprecation

Redis database version 6.0 is deprecated as of Redis Enterprise Software version 7.4.2 and will be removed in a future release.

To prepare for the future removal of Redis 6.0:

- For Redis Enterprise 6.2.* clusters, upgrade Redis 6.0 databases to Redis 6.2. See the [Redis 6.2 release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/6.2/00-RELEASENOTES) for the list of changes.

- For Redis Enterprise 7.2.4 and 7.4.2 clusters, upgrade Redis 6.0 databases to Redis 7.2. Before you upgrade your databases, see the list of [Redis 7.2 breaking changes]({{<relref "/rs/release-notes/rs-7-2-4-releases/rs-7-2-4-52#redis-72-breaking-changes">}}) and update any applications that connect to your database to handle these changes.

#### Operating system retirements

- RHEL 7 and Oracle Linux 7 were previously announced as deprecated in the [Redis Enterprise Software 7.2.4 release notes]({{<relref "/rs/release-notes/rs-7-2-4-releases#deprecations">}}). As of Redis Enterprise Software 7.4.2, RHEL 7 and Oracle Linux 7 are no longer supported.

#### Security retirements

- The RC4 encryption cipher, which was previously deprecated in favor of stronger ciphers, is no longer supported.

- The 3DES encryption cipher, which was previously deprecated in favor of stronger ciphers like AES, is no longer supported. Verify that all clients, applications, and connections support the AES cipher.

- TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 connections, which were previously deprecated in favor of TLS 1.2 or later, are no longer supported. Verify that all clients, applications, and connections support TLS 1.2 or later.

## Known limitations

#### New Cluster Manager UI limitations

The following legacy UI features are not yet available in the new Cluster Manager UI:

- Remove a node.

    Use the REST API or legacy UI instead. See [Remove a cluster node]({{<relref "/rs/clusters/remove-node">}}) for instructions.

- Purge an Active-Active instance.

    Use [`crdb-cli crdb purge-instance`]({{<relref "/rs/references/cli-utilities/crdb-cli/crdb/purge-instance">}}) instead.

- Search and export the log.

#### OpenSSL compatibility issue for 7.4.2 modules on Amazon Linux 2

Due to an OpenSSL 1.1 compatibility issue between modules and clusters, Redis Enterprise Software version 7.4.2-54 is not fully supported on Amazon Linux 2 clusters with databases that use the following modules: RedisGears, RediSearch, or RedisTimeSeries.

This issue will be fixed in a future maintenance release.

#### RedisGraph prevents upgrade to RHEL 9 

You cannot upgrade from a prior RHEL version to RHEL 9 if the Redis Enterprise cluster contains a RedisGraph module, even if unused by any database. The [RedisGraph module has reached End-of-Life](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/) and is completely unavailable in RHEL 9.
