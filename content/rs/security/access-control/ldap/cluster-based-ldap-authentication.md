As of v6.2.12, the features described in this article are [obsolete]({{< relref "/glossary/#obsolete" >}}) and have been removed from Redis Enterprise Software.<br/><br/>  
  
[Version 6.0.20]({{< relref "rs/release-notes/rs-6-0-20-april-2021" >}}) introduced a [role-based LDAP integration]({{< relref "/rs/security/access-control/ldap/" >}}) that  replaced the cluster-based integration described here.<br/><br/>

At the time, the earlier integration remained in order to provide a transition period for migration.  That period has now passed and the cluster-based integration has been removed.<br/><br/>

Redis Enterprise Software supports Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).<!--more-->

{{< note >}}
Known Limitations:

- LDAP access for database access is available only when using the role-based [LDAP authentication]({{<relref "/rs/security/access-control/ldap/">}}).
- This process does not apply when running Redis Enterprise for Kubernetes.
- Support for this integration was removed from Redis Enterprise Software v6.2.12.

## Enable LDAP

To enable LDAP:

1. Import the `saslauthd` configuration.
1. Restart `saslauthd` service.
1. Configure LDAP users.

## Configure LDAP

To provide the LDAP configuration information:

1. Edit the configuration file located at /etc/opt/redislabs/saslauthd.conf or the installation directory of your choice during initial configuration.
1. Provide the following information associated with each variable:

   - ldap_servers: the ldap servers that you authenticate against and the port to use
   - Provide the following information associated with each variable
        - **ldap_servers:** the ldap servers that you authenticate against and the port to use
            - Port 389 is standardly used for unencrypted LDAP connections
            - Port 636 is standardly used for encrypted LDAP connections and is strongly recommended.
        - **Ldap_tls_cacert_file (optional):** The path to your CA Certificates. This is required for encrypted LDAP connections only.
        - **ldap_filter:** the filter used to search for users.
        - **ldap_bind_dn:** The distinguished name for the user that will be used to authenticate to the LDAP server.
            - **ldap_password:** The password used for the user specified in ldap_bind_dn
1. Import the saslauthd configuration into Redis Enterprise using the below command. This will distribute the configuration to all nodes in the cluster.

    ```sh
    rladmin cluster config saslauthd_ldap_conf <path_to_saslauthd.conf>
    ```

    {{< note >}}
If this is a new server installation, for this command to work, a cluster must be set up already.
    {{< /note >}}

1. Restart `saslauthd`:

    ```sh
    sudo supervisorctl restart saslauthd
    ```

An example configuration for your reference may be found below:

```sh
ldap_servers: ldaps://ldap1.mydomain.com:636 ldap://ldap2.mydomain.com:636
ldap_tls_cacert_file: /path/to/your/CARootCert.crt
ldap_search_base: ou=coolUsers,dc=company,dc=com
ldap_search_base: ou=coolUsers,dc=company,dc=com
ldap_filter: (sAMAccountName=%u)
ldap_bind_dn: cn=admin,dc=company,dc=com
ldap_password: secretSquirrel
```

## Set up LDAP users in Redis Enterprise

To set up an LDAP user, simply select an external account type when configuring the user following the procedure to configure users.
