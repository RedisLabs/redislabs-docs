etc.

{{< expand "What client can I use to connect to the databases in Redis Enterprise?" >}}

{{% expand "What am I allowed to do with the trial version?" %}}
You can use, experience and administer the full capabilities of Redis
Enterprise Software (RS), but you may not deploy it in a production
environment. In addition, the trial version allows a maximum of four
shards and is limited to thirty (30) days of use after initial
installation on the first server in the cluster. After the thirty day
trial, the cluster shifts to read-only status. The free version does
not provide the same support options as the paid version. Finally, no
SLA is provided with the trial version. To continue operation of the
cluster with full capabilities, you must purchase a [subscription
cluster key from Redis Labs](https://redislabs.com/pricing).

{{< expand "What client can I use to connect to the databases in Redis Enterprise Software?" >}}
RS works with any standard Redis client.
Use your existing Redis client and code, as they work directly against a
RS cluster. You point your existing standard Redis client and code
connection string at the RS cluster, then scale on the RS cluster as
you need.

As explained in the open source [Redis FAQ](https://redis.io/topics/faq),
under "What happens if Redis runs out of memory?":

<blockquote>...[you] can use the "maxmemory" option in the config file to put a
limit to the memory Redis can use. If this limit is reached Redis
starts to reply with an error to write commands (but continues to
accept read-only commands), or you can configure it to evict keys when
the max memory limit is reached in the case you are using Redis for
caching.</blockquote>

You can set the **maxmemory** value of each Redis Enterprise Software database in
the management UI using the **Memory limit** property, as well as
configure an eviction policy by setting it to any of the standard Redis
behaviors, without interrupting database operations.
