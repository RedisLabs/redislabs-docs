Redis Cloud Pro delivers a cost-effective, fully managed
Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) offering, fully hosted on public clouds.

Redis Cloud Pro is based on the proven Redis Enterprise technology, serving thousands of
customers of our [Redis Enterprise
Cloud]({{< relref "/rc/_index.md" >}}) and [Redis Enterprise
Software]({{< relref "/rs/_index.md" >}})Â products. With Redis Cloud Pro,
you can deploy quickly on major public clouds and create Redis
databases that are fully compatible with the open-source Redis databases
contained on Redis Labs' cloud infrastrucure.

## Features

### Infinite and seamless scalability

Grow your dataset to any size needed (beyond the largest cloud
instances) without any downtime or limitation of Redis commands. We will
automatically add or remove instances to your cluster to accommodate
your fluctuating dataset size without any interruption to your
applications.

### Significant Cost Saving

For datasets larger than 50GB, running Redis on Flash delivers high
throughput with the same sub-millisecond latencies of Redis on RAM,
while cutting the cost of your cloud resources by over 70%.

### True high-availability

Achieve high availability for your Redis databases, with continuous
operation, no human intervention and zero operational effort. Redis
Labs' proven technology provides true high availability for Redis
deployments, safeguarding against all possible failure scenarios by
utilizing efficient diskless in-memory replication across racks, zones,
datacenters, and regions; instant automatic failover; persistence (AOF
or snapshot); backups and disaster recovery.

### Predictable high performance

Take advantage of the best performance in the industry using Redis
Enterprise Technology that enhances Redis with numerous optimizations
and hosts your database on optimal cloud instances.

### Hybrid deployment and geo-region replication

Efficiently replicate Redis databases between Redis Cloud Pro and
Redis Enterprise Software or across cloud regions, with built-in
compression and WAN optimization technologies. Create multi-region,
multi-cloud or hybrid (on-premises and cloud) Redis Enterprise
Deployments that accelerate your applications and require zero time to
recover.

### 24/7 Monitoring and support

Reap benefits from the tremendous operational expertise of the team that
develops and maintains open-source Redis and the professionals who
manage hundreds of thousands of Redis databases daily. Enjoy our 24/7
support via online helpdesk or phone.

### Encryption and authentication

Meet your security goals without compromising performance using Redis Could Pro's
fully encrypted SSL connections, and apply multi-level authentication
mechanisms such as:

- IP whitelist
- Client-based SSL authentication
- Redis password
- Data at rest encryption for compliance and security

### Fully-automated service

Forget instances, clusters, scaling, data persistence/high availability
settings and failure recovery.

### Multiple dedicated databases in one plan

Utilize multiple databases in a single cluster, each running in a
dedicated process and in a non-blocking manner.

### Email alerts

Receive instant notifications when memory or connection limits are
exceeded, or latency, high throughput or low throughput thresholds are
crossed.

### Unlimited database connection

Use as many database connections as you want.
