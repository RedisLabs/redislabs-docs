An RV Cloud Account contains all necessary credentials and information
for an account with your cloud provider. This Cloud Account enables RV
to create, manage, and monitor Cloud resources automatically on your
behalf.

Once a Cloud Account is set up you can reuse it with several
subscriptions.

## Create a new Cloud Account

To create an RV Cloud Account, please select **Cloud Accounts** from the
right side menu. Please follow [our
instructions]({{< relref "/rv/how-to/creating-aws-user-redis-enterprise-vpc.md" >}})
on how to set up a user for RV to use on your AWS account.
