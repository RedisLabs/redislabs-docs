After you create a subscription, you can view the subscription details and
change some of them, including:

- Subscription name
- Cloud account
- Security access
- Payment method

## Viewing Subscriptions

To view the details of a subscription click "Subscriptions" in the menu,
and then click on the name of the Subscription you wish to view.

When you view a subscription, you can see:

- Subscription name (To edit the name, click ![Edit](/images/rv/icon_edit.png "Edit"))
- The RV Cloud Account used by the subscription
- Cloud network details (To edit the details, click ![Edit](/images/rv/icon_edit.png "Edit"))

In the Security section, you can [define access](#defining-access-to-your-subscription)
to your VPC.

In the Payment Information section, you can see:

- The cloud resources that your subscription is running on
- The number of shards purchased and their cost

To delete a subscription, click on the **Delete** button at the bottom
of the form. You will be prompted to confirm before your subscription is
actually deleted. The delete will only occur if the subscription **does
not have any databases**. If it does, you must first delete the
databases.

## Defining Access to your Subscription

After you create an Redis Enterprise VPC (RV) subscription, you can configure VPC
peering and a CIDR whitelist to allow more direct access to your VPC. VPC
peering and CIDR whitelists are parts of functionality that is provided by [Amazon
Virtual Private Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/) (Amazon VPC),
but you can configure them here in RV.

- [VPC peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html)
    - The route tables of each VPC have access to the entire CIDR block of the peered VPC.
- [CIDR whitelist](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/peering-configurations-partial-access.html)
    - The route table of your VPC has access to the specified CIDR blocks and security groups.

1. In **Subscriptions**, click on the subscription use for VPC peering.

   to create a CIDR whitelist. Otherwise, click ![Add](/images/rs/icon_add.png "Add")
   under the list of CIDR whitelist entries to add another entry.

            you want to allow access for.
