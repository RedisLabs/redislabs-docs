To view your database, select **Databases** from the menu. You will see
a list of your databases grouped by Subscription.

![databases_main](/images/rv/databases_main.png?width=600&height=366)

In this view, you see pertinent information about each database and some
of its features. Since a Subscription can have multiple databases, you
can add one to a Subscription by clicking on the "+" button below each
Subscription table.

On the View Database page you will see four important icons next to the
title of the page:

- The pencil icon is for editing the database
- The trash can is for deleting the database
- The arrow icon is for importing data into the database
- The clock is for backing up the database (if backups are already
    configured)

To Edit a database, click on the pencil icon.

## Edit a Database

From the "View Database" page of the database you wish to edit, click on
the pencil icon to edit the database. This view allows you to edit the
database settings just as they were when the database was created. For
detailed descriptions of every field, read Create a Database.
