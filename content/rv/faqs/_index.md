{{%expand "How can I control access to my resources?" %}}
Redis Cloud Pro features the following access control mechanisms:

- Password authentication
- Source IP/Subnet ACL
- Security Group ACL

If you are using Redis Cloud Pro on your own AWS infrastructure and deploying it on the same VPC as your application servers, we use a special set of AWS security permissions to limit access to only the instances required for running the Redis Cloud Pro clusters. When deploying Redis Cloud Pro on a different VPC from your application servers or under a different AWS account of yours, all the operational aspects of managing Redis Cloud Pro are completely isolated from your application.

{{%expand "Why should I run Redis Cloud Pro on Flash?" %}}
Redis Labsâ€™ Redis on Flash technology enables you to run Redis on high IOPS SSD instances with high throughput and the same sub-millisecond latencies as RAM-based Redis. The economic benefit is dramatic: the cost of cloud instances required to support your database can be slashed by up to 70%, while maintaining the same blazing fast performance. As your data grows, and your processing needs increase, you can achieve cost-effective high speed operational and analytic processing with the versatility of Redis and the cost efficiency of Flash memory. If your dataset is larger than 500GB, running Redis in a fully-automated manner with 24/7 expert support over Redis Cloud Pro is lower in cost than managing your own Redis instances on the cloud.
