{{%/definition%}}

{{%definition "Active-Active database (CRDB)"%}}
Geo-distributed databases that span multiple [Redis Enterprise Software]({{<relref "#redis-enterprise-software">}}) [clusters]({{<relref "#cluster">}}). Active-Active databases depend on [multi-master replication (MMR)]({{<relref "#multi-master-replication-mmr">}}) and [conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)]({{<relref "#conflict-free-replicated-data-types-crdt">}}) to power a simple development experience for geo-distributed applications.

{{%/definition%}}

{{%definition "append-only file (AoF)"%}}

{{%/definition%}}

{{%definition "master node"%}}
Node that operates as the leader of a cluster
{{%/definition%}}

{{%definition "migration"%}}
Deciding when and where shards will be moved if more network throughput, memory, or CPU resources are needed
{{%/definition%}}

{{%definition "multi-factor authentication (MFA)"%}}
Method of authenticating users with pieces of evidence of the user's identity. When MFA is enabled on Redis Enterprise Cloud, users must enter their username, password, and an authentication code when logging in.

More info: [Multi-factor authentication]({{<relref "/rc/security/admin-console-security/multi-factor-authentication.md">}})
{{%/definition%}}

{{%definition "multi-master replication (MMR)"%}}
Multi-directional replication that power the efficient replication required to achieve active-active concurrent writes in Active-Active databases.
{{%/definition%}}

{{%definition "Out-of-Memory (OOM)"%}}
If a member Active-Active database is in an out of memory situation, that member is marked “inconsistent” by Redis Enterprise Software, the member stops responding to user traffic, and the syncer initiates full reconciliation with other peers in the Active-Active database.
{{%/definition%}}

{{%definition "participating clusters"%}}
Clusters participating in the multi-master replication of an Active-Active database.
{{%/definition%}}

{{%definition "provisioning"%}}
Deciding where shards will be created and placed.
