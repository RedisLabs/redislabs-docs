Several modules are included with [Redis Enterprise]({{<relref "/rs">}}). However, if you want to use additional modules or upgrade a module to a more recent version, you need to:

1. [Install a module package]({{<relref "/modules/install/add-module-to-cluster">}}) on the cluster.
1. [Enable a module]({{<relref "/modules/install/add-module-to-database">}}) for a new database or [upgrade a module]({{<relref "/modules/install/upgrade-module">}}) in an existing database.
