For this quick start tutorial, you'll need one of the following:

- [A Redis Enterprise]({{< relref "/modules/create-database-rs.md" >}}) database with the RedisGears module enabled,
- [A Redis Cloud Pro](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/) database with the RedisGears module enabled, or
- A Redis database with the RedisGears module installed

You'll also need to use the `redis-cli` command-line tool to connect to one of these Redis databases.

## RedisGears Basics

In this quick start guide, we'll see how to use RedisGears to perform batch processing and event processing.

With RedisGears, **batch processing** means processing the data already stored in a Redis database. **Event processing** means processing changes to the Redis key space.

The examples below assume an empty Redis database.
