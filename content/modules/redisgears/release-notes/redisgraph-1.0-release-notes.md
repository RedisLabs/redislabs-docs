## RedisGears 1.0.0 (May 2020)

This is the first GA Release of RedisGears (v1.0.0).

Highlights:

- Program everything you want in Redis - With a built-in C-API and Python interpreter, RedisGears lets you use full-fledged Python scripts and libraries to process data inside Redis.
- Write once, deploy anywhere - Write your functions against a standalone Redis database and deploy them to production clustersâ€”with no changes required.
- Run your serverless engine where your data lives - RedisGears lets you process events and streams faster by running in memory next to your data in Redis.

To get started please check out [redisgears.io](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisgears/). We plan to release a blogpost soon and will cross link it here.
