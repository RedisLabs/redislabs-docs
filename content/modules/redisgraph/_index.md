RedisGraph is the first queryable [Property Graph](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/blob/master/docs/property-graph-model.adoc) database to use [sparse matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) to represent the [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) in graphs and [linear algebra](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/GraphBLAS.html) to query the graph.

Primary features:

- Based on the [Property Graph Model](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/blob/master/docs/property-graph-model.adoc)
    - Nodes (vertices) and Relationships (edges) that may have attributes
    - Nodes that can be labeled
    - Relationships have a relationship type
- Graphs represented as sparse adjacency matrices
- [Cypher](http://www.opencypher.org/) as query language
    - Cypher queries translated into linear algebra expressions
