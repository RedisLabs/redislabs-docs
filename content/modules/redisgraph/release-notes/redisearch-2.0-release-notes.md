## RedisGraph 2.0 GA (2.0.1)

This is the General Availability Release of RedisGraph 2.0 (2.0.1)!

Headlines:

- Full Text Search (FTS) enabling Graph-aided Search.
- Full graph response enabling visualisation.
- Substantial amount of Cypher coverage.
- Performance improvements of up to 4x compared to RedisGraph 1.2.

(We will blog about this release soon including performance improvements results and the link here)

Full details:

- Major Features
    - #[339](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/339) [Full Graph Response](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisgraph/result_structure/#top-level-members).  RedisGraph now allows to return Graph entities such as Nodes and Relationships.  This feature also enables graph visualisation.
    - #[558](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/558) Indexing functionality replaced by [RediSearch](redisearch.io). This results in support for
        - compound indices
        - full text search
        - graph-aided search
    - #[691](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/691) RediSearch index is used with `IN` operator on indexed properties.
    - #[488](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/488) Replace flex/lemon parser with [libcypher-parser](https://github.com/cleishm/libcypher-parser).
    - #[574](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/574) Introduction of the array data type. This introduces significant support of Cypher as well as properties can be arrays on both nodes and relationships.
    - Cypher
        - #[714](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/714) `MERGE` can be combined with any other clause. `MERGE` will take into account bounded entities.
        - #[786](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/786) Support for passing all supported graph data types (Node, Relationship, Array,...) as arguments to procedure calls, rather than requiring all arguments to be Strings.
        - #[708](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/708) Named path support.
        - #[717](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/717) `count(*)`
        - #[730](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/730) `UNION`
        - #[757](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/757) `coalesce`
        - #[658](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/658) Support for `COUNT DISTINCT`
        - #[574](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/574) with the array data support comes `IN`, `collect`, `head`,`range`, `reverse`, `size`, `tail`
        - #[624](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/624) `randomUUID()`
        - #[632](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/632) `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL`.
        - #[594](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/594) Support dynamic inline properties for `CREATE` and `MERGE` patterns.
        - #[583](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/583) `NOT` Operator.
        - #[569](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/569) `timestamp()` function.
        - #[586](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/586) `CASE WHEN` (simple form).
        - #[582](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/582) `contains` function.
        - #[596](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/596) `indegree` and `outdegree` functions for nodes.
        - #[587](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/587) improved boolean logic.
        - #[539](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/539) Reusable entities in pattern matching.
    - #[668](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/668) PageRank support.
    - #[713](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/713) Parameterised queries support. Most client drivers are updated. This enables future performance enhancements for query caching.
    - #[662](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/662) Support for AOF.
- Enhancements
    - #[752](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/752) Use GraphBLAS 3.1.1.
    - #[674](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/674) `GRAPH.QUERY` will not fail even if graph doesn't exist.
    - #[613](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/613) Runtime arithmetic error handling.
- Performance Improvements
    - #[773](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/773) Bulk deletion of relationships. Deletion of relationships within the same query will be efficiently handled by batch operations in GraphBLAS.
    - #[783](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/783) Better replication support. Only write queries that mutate the graph or create indices will be replicated to AOF and slaves.

    - #[795](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/795) The underlying graph object's attributes were not updated on `RENAME`.

    - #[412](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/412) Better handling for `GRAPH.DELETE`.
    - #[537](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/537) Wrong row index within expand-into, enabled few TCK tests.
    - #[591](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/591) Emit validation error when an alias refers to both nodes and edges.
    - #[606](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/606) Fix Record ID of edges held in ExpandInto op.
    - #[607](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/607) All ops NULL-set variables in their free routines (memory).
    - #[893](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/893) Preserve the children array order when replacing operations.
