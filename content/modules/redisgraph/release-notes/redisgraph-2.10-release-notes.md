## v2.10 GA (v2.10.4) (November 2022)

This is the General Availability release of RedisGraph 2.10.

### Highlights

RedisGraph 2.10 introduces new path algorithms, additional expressivity (constructs and functions), performance improvements, and bug fixes.

#### What's new in 2.10

- New pathfinding algorithms: 
  - The `algo.SPpaths` procedure yields one, _n_, or all minimal-weight, optionally bounded-cost, optionally bounded-length paths between a given pair of nodes.
  - The `algo.SSpaths` procedure yields one, _n_, or all minimal-weight, optionally bounded-cost, optionally bounded-length paths from a given node.
- Introduce `SET` for adding node labels and `REMOVE` for removing node labels, node properties, and edge properties.
- Support deleting paths with `DELETE`.
- Introduce 29 functions: `toBoolean`, `toBooleanOrNull`, `toFloatOrNull`, `toIntegerOrNull`, `toStringOrNull`, `toBooleanList`, `toFloatList`, `toIntegerList`, `toStringList`, `properties`, `split`, `last`, `isEmpty`, `e`, `exp`, `log`, `log10`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `cot`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `atan2`, `degrees`, `radians`, `pi`, and `haversin`.
- Graph slow log can be reset with `GRAPH.SLOWLOG g RESET`.
- Queries are now atomic (_Atomicity_ is the guarantee that each query either succeeds or fails with no side effects). Whenever a failure occurs, the query effect is rolled back from an undo log.

### Details
