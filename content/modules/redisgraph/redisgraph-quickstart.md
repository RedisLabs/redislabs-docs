For this quick start tutorial, you need:

- Either:
    - A Redis Cloud database [with the RedisGraph module]({{< relref "/rc/administration/setup/create-database.md" >}})

        You can [set up a free Redis Cloud database]({{< relref "/modules/modules-quickstart.md" >}}) to see the module in action.
    - A Redis Enterprise Software database [with the RedisGraph module]({{< relref "/modules/add-module-to-database.md" >}})
- redis-cli with connectivity to a redis database

## Developing with RedisGraph

Before using RedisGraph, you should familiarize yourself with its commands and syntax as detailed in the
[commands reference](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisgraph/commands/).

After you load RedisGraph, you can interact with it using redis-cli.

Here we'll quickly create a small graph representing a subset of motorcycle riders and teams
taking part in the MotoGP league. Once created, we'll start querying our data.

### With `redis-cli`

```sh
127.0.0.1:12543> GRAPH.QUERY MotoGP "CREATE (:Rider {name:'Valentino Rossi'})-[:rides]->(:Team {name:'Yamaha'}), (:Rider {name:'Dani Pedrosa'})-[:rides]->(:Team {name:'Honda'}), (:Rider {name:'Andrea Dovizioso'})-[:rides]->(:Team {name:'Ducati'})"
1) (empty list or set)
2) 1) Labels added: 2
   2) Nodes created: 6
   3) Properties set: 6
   4) Relationships created: 3
   5) "Query internal execution time: 0.399000 milliseconds"
```

Now that our MotoGP graph is created, we can start asking questions. For example:
Who's riding for team Yamaha?

```sh
127.0.0.1:12543> GRAPH.QUERY MotoGP "MATCH (r:Rider)-[:rides]->(t:Team) WHERE t.name = 'Yamaha' RETURN r,t"
1) 1) 1) "r.name"
      2) "t.name"
   2) 1) "Valentino Rossi"
      2) "Yamaha"
2) 1) "Query internal execution time: 0.122000 milliseconds"
```

How many riders represent team Ducati?

```sh
127.0.0.1:12543> GRAPH.QUERY MotoGP "MATCH (r:Rider)-[:rides]->(t:Team {name:'Ducati'}) RETURN count(r)"
1) 1) 1) "count(r)"
   2) 1) "1.000000"
2) 1) "Query internal execution time: 0.129000 milliseconds"
```

### With any other client

You can interact with RedisGraph using your client's ability to send raw Redis commands.
The exact method for doing that depends on your client of choice.

#### Python example

This code snippet shows how to use RedisGraph with raw Redis commands from Python using
[redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py):

```python
import redis

r = redis.StrictRedis()
reply = r.execute_command('GRAPH.QUERY', 'social', "CREATE (:person {name:'roi', age:33, gender:'male', status:'married')")
```

### Client libraries

Some languages have client libraries that provide support for RedisGraph's commands:
