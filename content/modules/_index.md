Redis Labs develops several modules that extend the core Redis feature set. Some of the features these modules provide include [querying, indexing and full-text search]({{< relref "/modules/redisearch" >}}), [JSON support]({{< relref "/modules/redisjson" >}}), and [probabalistic data structures]({{< relref "/modules/redisbloom" >}}).

You can use the modules listed here with [Redis Enterprise Software]({{< relref "/rs" >}}) and [Redis Cloud]({{< relref "/rc" >}}).

Each module has its own quick start guide to help you get up and running quickly.
