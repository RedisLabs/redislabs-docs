## v2.2.5 (November 2021)

This is the General Availability release of RediSearch 2.2.

### Headlines

#### Searching and indexing JSON documents

This release introduces the ability to [index, query, and full-text search JSON documents](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/master/Indexing_JSON/) using JSONPath queries.

On the schema creation [FT.CREATE](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/master/Commands/#ftcreate), it is now possible to map a JSONPath query with a field. When a JSON document is indexed, the value extracted by the JSONPath query is indexed in the given field.

 _This features require the module [RedisJSON 2.0](https://www.redisjson.io) to be installed._ 

#### Profiling queries

With the new [FT.PROFILE](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/master/Commands/#ftprofile) command, it is now possible to profile in detail the execution time of several internal steps involved in the execution of [FT.SEARCH](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/master/Commands/#ftsearch) and [FT.AGGREGATE](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/master/Commands/#ftaggregate).
That way, it is possible to understand which part of the query is taking most of the resources.

#### Field aliasing

With the support of JSON document indexing, it is now possible to map a JSONPath query to an alias. Therefore, it is possible to index the same value in different fields with different indexing strategies.

{{<note>}}
As of RediSearch v2.2, `fields` are now known as `attributes`.

Notes:
This is the first GA version of 2.2. The version inside Redis will be 2.2.5 in semantic versioning.
_Since the version of a module in Redis is numeric, we could not add a GA flag._
