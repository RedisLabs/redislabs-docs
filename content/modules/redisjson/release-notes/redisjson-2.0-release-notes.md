### Headlines

RedisJSON is a [high-performance JSON document store](https://redis.com/blog/redisjson-public-preview-performance-benchmarking/) that allows developers to build modern applications. It stores and processes JSON in-memory, supporting millions of operations per second with sub-millisecond response times. The combination of `RediSearch`, native indexing, querying, and full-text search of JSON documents allows developers to create secondary indexes and query data at lightning speed.

#### Indexing JSON documents

Using [RediSearch](https://redisearch.io), it is now possible to [index, query, and search JSON documents](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/master/Indexing_JSON/), gaining full-text search capabilities and document retrieving based on their content.

To do so, you must install both modules, `RedisJSON` and `RediSearch`, on the same database.

#### Support of JSON Path

The commands [support JSONPath](https://oss.redis.com/redisjson/2.0/path/#jsonpath-support-redisjson-v2) as specified in the [original specifications](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath).

The legacy path syntax is still supported.

#### Commands operate on multiple paths

A `JSONPath` query may resolve to several paths. Every [command](https://oss.redis.com/redisjson/commands/) supports multiple paths and applies the operation to all the encountered paths.

Notice that the output of the commands evolved to provide multiple results according to the number of paths impacted.
