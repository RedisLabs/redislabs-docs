This release contains some bug fixes over 1.0.2. It also includes some ci changes as well.

## v1.0.1 (December 2017)

This version provides a serialization cache for JSON.GET (when used with the
default parameters). The cache policy is LRU (last recently used), and extremely
small items are not cached.

In the future, options may be added to configure the cache, but for the time being
the cache is intended to be small and transparent.
