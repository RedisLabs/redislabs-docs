For this quick start tutorial, you need:

- Either:
    - A Redis Cloud database [with the RedisBloom module]({{< relref "/rc/administration/setup/create-database.md" >}})

        You can [set up a free Redis Cloud database]({{< relref "/modules/modules-quickstart.md" >}}) to see the module in action.
    - A Redis Enterprise Software database with [the RedisBloom module]({{< relref "/modules/add-module-to-database.md" >}})
- redis-cli with connectivity to a redis database

## Debugging Bloom filters

Finally, I added a BF.DEBUG command, to see exactly how the filter is
being utilized:

```sh
 127.0.0.1:6379> BF.DEBUG test
 1) "size:987949"
 2) "bytes:239627 bits:1917011 hashes:14 capacity:100000 size:100000 ratio:0.0001"
 3) "bytes:551388 bits:4411101 hashes:16 capacity:200000 size:200000 ratio:2.5e-05"
 4) "bytes:1319180 bits:10553436 hashes:19 capacity:400000 size:400000 ratio:3.125e-06"
 5) "bytes:3215438 bits:25723497 hashes:23 capacity:800000 size:287949 ratio:1.95313e-07"
```

This outputs the total number of elements as the first result, and then
a list of details for each filter in the chain. As you can see, whenever
a new filter is added, its capacity grows exponentially and the
strictness for errors increases.

Note that this filter chain also uses a total of 5MB. This is still much
more space efficient than alternative solutions, since we're still at
about 5 bytes per element, and the uppermost filter is only at about 12%
utilization. Had the initial capacity been greater, more space would
have been saved and lookups would have been quicker.
