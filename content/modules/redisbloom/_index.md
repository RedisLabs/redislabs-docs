A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure which provides an
efficient way to verify that an entry is certainly *not* in a set. This
makes it especially ideal when trying to search for items on
expensive-to-access resources (such as over a network or disk): If I
have a large on-disk database and I want to know if the key *foo* exists
in it, I can query the Bloom filter first, which tells me with a
certainty whether it potentially exists (and then the disk lookup can
continue) or whether it does *not* exist, and in this case I can forego
the expensive disk lookup and simply send a negative reply up the stack.

While it's possible to use other data structures (such as a hash table)
to perform this, Bloom filters are also especially useful in that they
occupy very little space per element, typically counted in the number of
*bits* (not bytes!). There exists a percentage of false positives
(which is controllable), but for an initial test of whether a key exists
in a set, they provide excellent speed and most importantly excellent
space efficiency.

Bloom filters are used in a wide variety of applications such as ad
serving - making sure a user doesn't see an ad too often; likewise in
content recommendation systems - ensuring recommendations don't appear
too often, in databases - quickly checking if an entry exists in a
table before accessing it on disk, and so on.

## How Bloom filters work

Most of the literature on Bloom filter uses highly symbolic and/or
mathematical descriptions to describe it. If you're mathematically
challenged like yours truly, you might find my explanation more useful.

A Bloom filter is an array of many bits. When an element is 'added' to a
bloom filter, the element is hashed. Then *bit\[hashval % nbits\]* is
set to 1. This looks fairly similar to how buckets in a hash table are
mapped. To check if an item is present or not, the hash is computed and
the filter sees if the corresponding bit is set or not.

Of course, this is subject to collisions. If a collision happens, the
filter returns a false positive - indicating that the entry is
indeed found (note that a bloom filter never returns a false
negative, that is, claim that something does not exist when it fact it
is present).

In order to reduce the risk of collisions, an entry may use more than
one bit: the entry is hashed *bits_per_element (bpe)* times with a
different seed for each iteration resulting in a different hash value,
and for each hash value, the corresponding *hash % nbits* bit is set. To
check if an entry exists, the candidate key is also hashed *bpe* times,
and if any corresponding bit is *unset*, then it can be determined with
certainty that the item does *not* exist.

The actual value of *bpe* is determined at the time the filter is
created. Generally the more bits per element, the lower the likelihood
of false positives.

In the example above, all three bits would need to be set in order for
the filter to return a positive result.

Another value affecting the accuracy of a Bloom filter is its *fill
ratio*, or how many bits in the filter are actually set. If a filter has
a vast majority of bits set, the likelihood of any specific lookup
returning false is decreased, and thus the possibility of the filter
returning false positives is increased.

## Scalable Bloom filters

Typically Bloom filters must be created with a foreknowledge of how many
entries they contain. The *bpe* number needs to be fixed, and
likewise, the width of the bit array is also fixed.
Unlike hash tables, Bloom filters cannot be "rebalanced" because there
is no way to know *which* entries are part of the filter (the filter can
only determine whether a given entry is *not* present, but does not
actually store the entries which *are* present).

In order to allow Bloom filters to 'scale' and be able to accommodate
more elements than they've been designed to, they may be stacked. Once a
single Bloom filter reaches capacity, a new one is created atop it.
Typically the new filter has greater capacity than the previous
one in order to reduce the likelihood of needing to stack yet another
filter.

In a stackable (scalable) Bloom filter, checking for membership now
involves inspecting each layer for presence. Adding new items now
involves checking that it does not exist beforehand, and adding it to
the current filter. Hashes still only need to be computed once, however.

When creating a Bloom filter - even a scalable one, it's important to
have a good idea of how many items it is expected to contain. A filter
whose initial layer can only contain a small number of elements will
degrade performance significantly because it will take more layers to
reach a larger capacity.
