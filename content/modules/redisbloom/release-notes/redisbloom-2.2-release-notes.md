## v2.2.0 (December 2019)

- Added functionality
    - Bloom
        - #[149](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/149) `BF.INFO` returns [details](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/Bloom_Commands/#bfinfo) about a specific bloom filter
        - Scalable
            - #[153](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/153) [Ability to change](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/Bloom_Commands/#bfreserve) the `EXPANSION` rate. This means each subsequent sub-filter will be `expansion` times larger as the previous one.
            - #[160](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/160) Optimise the scaling up of filter according to the [Scalable Bloom Filter](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55607643.pdf) paper
            - #[161](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/161) [Optional](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/Bloom_Commands/#bfreserve) `NONSCALING` argument to disable scaling.  (This saves space since less hash functions are used)
        - #[155](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/155) Disabling rounding up functionality
    - Cuckoo
        - #[149](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/149) `CF.INFO` returns [details](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/Cuckoo_Commands/#cfinfo) about a specific cuckoo filter
        - Scalable
            - #[138](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/138) [Configurable](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/Cuckoo_Commands/#cfreserve) `EXPANSION`. When an additional filter is created, its size will be the size of the current filter multiplied by the `expansion`.  Higher expansion rates will result in lower error rates.
            - #[142](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/142) The maximum number of expansions limited to 32.
            - #[131](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/131) [Configurable](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/Cuckoo_Commands/#cfreserve) `MAXITERATIONS`. Number of attempts to swap buckets before declaring filter as full and creating an additional filter.
        - #[135](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/135)  [Configurable](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/Cuckoo_Commands/#cfreserve)  `BUCKETSIZE`. Number of items in each bucket. Higher bucket size value improves the fill rate but result in a higher error rate and slightly slower operation speed.
        - #[142](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/142) use of 64bit hash function
        - #[136](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/136) expose compaction of filters in the API
    - CMS
        - #[97](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/97) `CMS.INCRBY` [returns count](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/CountMinSketch_Commands/#cmsincrby) instead of ‘OK’

- Minor bug fixes
    - Bloom
        - #[154](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/154) Check error rate is 1< (cannot be equal)
    - Cuckoo
        - #[134](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/134) Added `CuckooInsert_MemAllocFailed` exception
        - #[130](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/130) Number of deletes wasn’t saved to RDB
    - General
        - #[117](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/117) Using `RMUtil_RegisterWriteDenyOOMCmd`
        - #[121](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/121) Moved `ReplicaVerbatim` to end of functions
