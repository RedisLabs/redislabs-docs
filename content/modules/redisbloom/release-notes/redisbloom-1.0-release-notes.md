## RedisBloom 1.0.3 (December 2017)

This contains a single fix, issue #[19](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/19).

From this version onwards, `EXISTS`/`MEXISTS` will return 0 if the (Redis) key does not exist in the DB, rather than return an error.

## RedisBloom 1.0.2 (November 2017)

## RedisBloom 1.0.0 (September 2017)

This is the first GA release of ReBloom.
