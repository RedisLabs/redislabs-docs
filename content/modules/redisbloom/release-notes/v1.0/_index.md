## RedisBloom v1.0.3 Release Notes

This contains a single fix, issue #[19](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/19) 

From this version onwards, `EXISTS`/`MEXISTS` will return 0 if the (Redis) key does not exist in the DB, rather than return an error.

## RedisBloom v1.0.2 Release Notes

## RedisBloom v1.0.0 Release Notes

This is the first GA release of ReBloom.
