## RedisAI 1.0.0 (May 2020)

Supported Backends:

- TensorFlow Lite 2.0
- TensorFlow 1.15.0
- PyTorch 1.5
- ONXXRuntime 1.2.0

New features:

- #[241](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/241), #[270](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/270) auto-batching support. Requests from multiple clients can be automatically and transparently batched in a single request for increased CPU/GPU efficiency during serving.
- #[322](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/322) Add [AI.DAGRUN](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisai/commands/#aidagrun). With the new AI.DAGRUN (DAG as in direct acycilc graph) command we support the prescription of combinations of other AI.* commands in a single execution pass, where intermediate keys are never materialised to Redis.
- #[334](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/334) Add [AI.DAGRUN_RO](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisai/commands/#ai.dagrun_ro) command, a read-only variant of AI.DAGRUN
- #[338](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/338) [AI.MODELSET](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisai/commands/#ai.modelset) Added the possibility to provide a model in chunks.
- #[332](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/332) Standardized GET methods (TENSORGET,MODELGET,SCRIPTGET) replies (breaking change for clients)
- #[331](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/331) Cache model blobs for faster serialization and thread-safety.

Minor Enhancements:

- #[289](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/289) Memory access and leak fixes.
- #[319](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/319) Documentation improvements.

Build Enhancements:

- #[299](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/299) Coverage info.
- #[273](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/273) Enable running valgrind/callgrind on test platform
- #[277](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/277), #[296](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/296) tests extension and refactoring per backend.
