New Features:

- [#241](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/241), [#270](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/270) auto-batching support. Requests from multiple clients can be automatically and transparently batched in a single request for increased CPU/GPU efficiency during serving.
- [#322](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/322) Add [AI.DAGRUN](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisai/commands/#aidagrun). With the new AI.DAGRUN (DAG as in direct acycilc graph) command we support the prescription of combinations of other AI.* commands in a single execution pass, where intermediate keys are never materialised to Redis.
- [#334](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/334) Add [AI.DAGRUN_RO](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisai/commands/#ai.dagrun_ro) command, a read-only variant of AI.DAGRUN
- [#338](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/338) [AI.MODELSET](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisai/commands/#ai.modelset) Added the possibility to provide a model in chunks.
- [#332](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/332) Standardized GET methods (TENSORGET,MODELGET,SCRIPTGET) replies (breaking change for clients)
- [#331](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/331) Cache model blobs for faster serialization and thread-safety.

Minor Enhancements:

- [#289](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/289) Memory access and leak fixes.
- [#319](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/319) Documentation improvements.

Build Enhancements:

- [#299](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/299) Coverage info.
- [#273](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/273) Enable running valgrind/callgrind on test platform
