1. Navigate to the **Assign AZs and Network** section on the right navigation bar.

    Ensure you have regions selected in each section and a network selected for the cluster to use.

1. Click **Save**.

    A banner appears at the top of the page indicating changes have been successfully applied.

1. Navigate to the **Cluster Configuration** section on the left navigation bar and enter the following details:

   - **Cluster Name**: Provide a subdomain for the cluster name. The Redis Enterprise cluster name is a subdomain under the system domain,
    which is found under the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) in Ops Manager (PAS->Settings->Domains).
    For example, set the cluster name as `CLUSTERNAME.sys.redislabs.com` if your system domain is `sys.redislabs.com`.
    The cluster name becomes part of the connection string for Redis apps when connecting to Redis Enterprise databases using DNS-based connections.
   - **Admin Email**: Provide an email for the account that you want to have full administrative privileges to the new Redis Enterprise cluster.
   - **Admin account password**: Provide the password for the administrative account.
   - Optionally, for production clusters, you can also provide a static IP address of a set of static IP addresses (comma-separated) to use for cluster nodes. You can also enable Multiple Availability Zone (Rack) awareness.
   - Save your changes by clicking **Save**.

    {{< note >}}
Make sure that the **Cluster Recovery** option is not selected during installation.
This option is only for when you recover a cluster.

1. Navigate to the **Routing** section on the left navigation bar.

    If you would like to enable TCP Routing, configure the fields in this section. Otherwise, select **Disable**.
    Save your changes by clicking **Save**.

1. Navigate to the **Service Plans** section on the left navigation bar.

    You can optionally add, remove or edit plans or choose to keep pre-configured plans.
    Save your changes by clicking **Save**.

1. Optionally, navigate to the **Loggregator** section on the left navigation bar.

    You can check the box to *enable exposing cluster metric* if you would like to enable Loggregator functionality.
    You can also set the *Metrics scrape interval* in seconds.
    The default is 15 second.
    Save your changes by clicking **Save**.

1. Navigate to the **Resource Config** section on the left navigation bar.

    Ensure there are resources assigned to the required resources for Redis Enterprise.
    If you chose to enable metric export to **Loggregator**  in the previous step, you must ensure that exactly 1 *loggregator-agent* instance is configured.
