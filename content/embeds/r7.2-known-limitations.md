### Known limitations

There are two known limitations for the version of Redis 7.2 that is packaged with Redis Enterprise.

- Using [`XREADGROUP BLOCK`](https://redis.io/commands/xreadgroup/) with `>` to return all new streams will cause the Redis database to freeze until the shard is restarted ([#12031](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12301))

- Because a rejected command does not record the duration for command stats, an error will appear after it is reprocessed that will cause the Redis database to freeze until the shard is restarted ([#12247](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12247))
