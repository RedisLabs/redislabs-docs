Yes we are. Not only are we are the home of Redis, but most of Redis’ core engineers also work for Redis Labs! We contribute extensively to the open source Redis project. As a rule, we adhere to the open source’s specifications and make every effort to update our service with its latest versions.

That said, the following Redis features are not applicable in the context of our service:

- Shared databases aren’t supported in our service given their potential negative impact on performance. We recommend using dedicated databases instead ([read this post for more information](https://redislabs.com/blog/benchmark-shared-vs-dedicated-redis-instances/)). Therefore, the following commands are blocked and show an error when used:
    - [MOVE](http://redis.io/commands/move)
    - [SELECT](http://redis.io/commands/select)
- Data persistence and backups are managed from the service’s web interface, so the following commands are blocked:
    - [BGREWRITEAOF](http://redis.io/commands/BGREWRITEAOF)
    - [BGSAVE](http://redis.io/commands/bgsave)
    - [LASTSAVE](http://redis.io/commands/LASTSAVE)
    - [SAVE](http://redis.io/commands/SAVE)
- Since replication is managed automatically by the service and since it could present a security risk, the following commands are blocked:
    - [MIGRATE](http://redis.io/commands/MIGRATE)
    - [REPLCONF](http://redis.io/commands/REPLCONF)
    - [SLAVEOF](http://redis.io/commands/SLAVEOF)
    - [SYNC](http://redis.io/commands/SYNC)/[PSYNC](http://redis.io/commands/PSYNC)
- Redis Labs clustering technology is different than the open source Redis Cluster and supports clustering in a seamless manner that works with all standard Redis clients. As a result, [all Cluster related commands](http://redis.io/commands#cluster) are blocked and show an error when used.
- Redis Labs clustering technology allows [multiple active proxies](http://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/administering/designing-production/networking/multiple-active-proxy.md). As a result, the CLIENT ID command cannot guarantee incremental IDs between clients who connect to different nodes under multi proxy policies.
- Commands that aren’t relevant for a hosted Redis service are blocked:
    - [CONFIG RESETSTAT](http://redis.io/commands/CONFIG-RESETSTAT)
    - [DEBUG OBJECT](http://redis.io/commands/DEBUG-OBJECT)/[SEGFAULT](http://redis.io/commands/DEBUG-SEGFAULT)
    - [OBJECT](http://redis.io/commands/OBJECT)
    - [SHUTDOWN](http://redis.io/commands/SHUTDOWN)
    - [CLIENT PAUSE](http://redis.io/commands/CLIENT-PAUSE)
    - [COMMAND INFO](http://redis.io/commands/COMMAND-INFO)
    - [COMMAND COUNT](http://redis.io/commands/COMMAND-COUNT)
    - [COMMAND GETKEYS](http://redis.io/commands/COMMAND-GETKEYS)
    - [LATENCY LATEST](http://redis.io/commands/LATENCY-LATEST)
    - [LATENCY HISTORY](http://redis.io/commands/LATENCY-HISTORY)
    - [LATENCY RESET](http://redis.io/commands/LATENCY-RESET)
    - [LATENCY GRAPH](http://redis.io/commands/LATENCY-GRAPH)
    - [LATENCY DOCTOR](http://redis.io/commands/LATENCY-DOCTOR)
    - [MEMORY STATS](https://redis.io/commands/memory-stats)
    - [MEMORY DOCTOR](https://redis.io/commands/memory-doctor)
    - [MEMORY MALLOC-STATS](https://redis.io/commands/memory-malloc-stats)
    - [MEMORY PURGE](https://redis.io/commands/memory-purge)
    - [MODULE LOAD](https://redis.io/commands/module-load)
    - [MODULE UNLOAD](https://redis.io/commands/module-unload)
    - [MODULE LIST](https://redis.io/commands/module-list)
- Additionally, only a subset of Redis’ configuration settings (via CONFIG GET/SET) is applicable to Redis Cloud. Attempts to get or set a configuration parameter that isn’t included in the following list show an error when used:
    - hash-max-ziplist-entries
    - hash-max-ziplist-value
    - list-max-ziplist-entries
    - list-max-ziplist-value
    - notify-keyspace-events
    - set-max-intset-entries
    - slowlog-log-slower-than (value must be larger than 1000)
    - slowlog-max-len (value must be between 128 and 1024)
    - zset-max-ziplist-entries
    - zset-max-ziplist-value
- Lastly, unlike Redis’ 512MB limit, the maximum size of key names in our service is 64KB (key values, however, can have sizes up to 512MB).
