 [Versions 6.4.2 and later]({{<relref "/kubernetes/release-notes/6-4-2-releases/">}}) uses a new `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` resource to replace `redb-admission`. To use newer releases, delete the old webhook resource and apply the new file.

1. Delete the existing `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` on the Kubernetes cluster (named `redb-admission`).

    ```sh
    kubectl delete ValidatingWebhookConfiguration redb-admission
    ```

1. Apply the resource from the new file.

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f deploy/admission/webhook.yaml
    ```
