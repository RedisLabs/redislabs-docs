Redis Enterprise Software (RS) is supported on several operating systems, cloud environments, and virtual environments.

{{< note >}}
Make sure your system meets these requirements:

- Only 64-bit operating systems are supported.
- You must install Redis Enterprise Software directly on the host, not through system cloning.
- You must install on a clean host with no other applications running so that all RAM is allocated to the OS and RS only.
- Linux distributions must be installed with at least "Minimal Install" configuration.

## VMware

Redis Enterprise is compatible with VMware, but make sure that you:

- Configure your memory, CPU, network, and storage settings to allow for optimal Redis Enterprise performance.
- Pin each Redis Enterprise shard to a specific ESX/ESXi host by setting the appropriate affinity rules.
- If you must manually migrate a virtual machine to another host, follow the best practices for shard maintenance and contact support if you have questions.
- Disable VMware VMotion because Redis Enterprise is not compatible with VMotion.
- Don't use VMware snapshots because Redis Enterprise cluster manages state dynamically, so a snapshot might not have the correct node and cluster state.
