Redis Labs has enhanced open source Redis with a technology layer that encapsulates open source Redis, while fully supporting all its commands, data structures and modules. It adds exceptional flexibility, stable high performance and unmatched resilience, as well as multiple deployment choices (public and private clouds, on-premises, hybrid, RAM-Flash combination), topology (active-active, active-passive, active-replica) and support for very large dataset sizes. This enhanced and exponentially more powerful database platform is Redis Enterprise.
