## 1.13.1 (November 2022)

This is the maintenance release of RedisInsight 1.13 (v1.13.1).

### Fixes:
- Core:
  - Fixed container vulnerabilities.
  - Prevented healthcheck API from overloading RedisInsight DB. Earlier, a separate session was created for each healthcheck hit, which overloaded the database with too many session tokens. Now, healtcheck API doesn't create any session tokens.
