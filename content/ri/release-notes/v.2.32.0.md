## 2.32 (August 2023)
This is the General Availability (GA) release of RedisInsight 2.32.

### Highlights
- Easily provision a free database to use with the RedisInsight interactive tutorials to learn, among others, how to leverage Vector Similarity Search for your AI use cases or discover the power of the native JSON data structure supporting structured querying and full-text search. Take advantage of the in-app social sign-up to [Redis Cloud](https://redis.com/comparisons/oss-vs-enterprise/?utm_source=redisinsight&utm_medium=rel_notes&utm_campaign=2_32) to quickly provision a free database with [Redis Stack’s capabilities](https://redis.io/docs/about/about-stack/?utm_source=redisinsight&utm_medium=rel_notes&utm_campaign=2_32). Try the [latest 7.2](https://redis.com/blog/introducing-redis-7-2/?utm_source=redisinsight&utm_medium=rel_notes&utm_campaign=2_32) release which delivers the new [Triggers and Functions](https://redis.com/blog/introducing-triggers-and-functions/?utm_source=redisinsight&utm_medium=rel_notes&utm_campaign=2_32) feature, allowing you to execute server-side functions written in JavaScript that are either triggered by a keyspace change, by a stream entry arrival, or by explicitly calling them, empowering developers to build and maintain real-time applications by moving business logic closer to the data, ensuring a lower latency whilst delivering the best developer experience.
- Select a custom installation directory on Windows OS for when multi-user access to the app is required.
