## 2.42 (January 2024)
This is the General Availability (GA) release of RedisInsight 2.42.

### Highlights
- Introducing a new dedicated developer enablement area! Explore Redis capabilities and learn easily, among other things, how to leverage the native JSON data structure supporting structured querying and full-text search, including vector similarity search for your AI use cases. Browse the tutorials offline or leverage the in-app provisioning of a free Redis Cloud database to try them interactively.
- RedisInsight is now available on Docker. Check out our [Docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/redis/redisinsight/general) if that’s your preferred platform.

Dive into interactive tutorials and level up your Redis game even without a database connected. Start exploring tutorials by clicking on the "Insights" button located in the top-right corner. Because interactive tutorials can alter data in your database, avoid running them in a production environment.
