This release includes:

## New Features
- Core: Added support for Redis databases that require TLS client authentication, like Redis Enterprise
- RedisTimeseries: Enable auto-updating query when the end timestamp is `+`
- RedisGraph: Usability improvement - fix the height of query cards
- RediSearch: Add support for zero-length and whitespace-only index names

## Bug Fixes
- Moved server to another thread instead of a separate process
  There was a long-existing problem with the server process being orphaned after the main process dies. This caused a host of issues, including the "blank page" issue. Now that the server process is in a thread instead of a process, it's never possible that the server is left running when the process exits.
- Check whether the port is available before starting
- Made `localhost` the default host. Previously, we used to bind to `0.0.0.0` by default.
- Improved logging during startup
- Browser: Better handling of unsupported values - link to other tools that support it or show better error message
- Browser: Fixed UI issues when the screen size is varied, i.e, better responsiveness
- RediSearch: Fix several bugs in the way results are summarized in the table view
