### Cluster Support Improvements

- Ask for seed nodes when adding a cluster
- Added 2 cluster management alerts:
    - Seed nodes don't agree on cluster configuration
    - All seed nodes are down
- Fixed "flickering" issue after a slave node is deleted.

### Minor Bug Fixes

- Skip already processed key in rename bulk ops
- CSS fix for update version dialog
- Handle case of unlimited instances for adding sentinel masters
