### New features

- RedisGraph tool
    A basic UI for running RedisGraph queries with a historic view of queries.
    **Note**: The RedisGraph tool is an alpha feature at this point and will only be enabled for a subset of early users.

- RedisJSON support in Browser
    Now, if the size of the JSON value exceeds a threshold, it will not be displayed in the browser, instead the user can download the entire JSON value directly as a file.

- Bulk Operations Improvements
    - A history of executed jobs is now available in the Bulk Operations tool.
    - The internal implementation has been changed to be more reliable and accurate, especially when dealing with binary data.
