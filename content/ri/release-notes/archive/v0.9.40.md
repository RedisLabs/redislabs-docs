### Features

- New RediSearch tool, which allows executing and visualising RediSearch queries. This is a preview feature, alpha quality. Not exposed to end users.
- Instance IDs are now UUIDs. This is a security improvement over using serial numbers

### Bug fixes

- Streams Tool:
    - The time slider was not handing empty streams properly.
    - The timestamps now show seconds as well, and in the same format as the slider
    - Avoiding extra API call when a key is not selected
- Browser search bar was not responding if all keys in the redis database are loaded.
