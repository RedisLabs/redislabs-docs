- Raw mode in Workbench: Added support for the raw mode in Workbench results

### Details
**Features and improvements**
- [#978](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/pull/978), [#959](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/pull/959), [#984](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/pull/984), [#996](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/pull/996), [#992](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/pull/992), [#1030](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/pull/1030) Added support for different data formats in Browser/Tree view, including JSON, MessagePack, Hex, and ASCII. If selected, formatter is applied to the entire key value and is available for any data type supported in Browser/Tree view. If any non-printable characters are detected, data editing is available only in Workbench and CLI to avoid data loss.
- [#955](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/pull/965) Quickly clone a database connection to have the same one, but with a different database index, username, or password. Open a database connection in the edit mode, request to clone it, and make the changes needed. The original database connection remains the same.
- [#1012](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/pull/1012) Added support for the raw mode (--raw) in Workbench. Enable it to see the results of commands executed in the raw mode.
- [#987](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/pull/987) [DBSIZE](https://redis.io/commands/dbsize/) command is no longer required to connect to a database.
- [#971](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/pull/971) Updated icon for the [RediSearch](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/) Light module.
- [#1011](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/pull/1011) Enhanced navigation in the Command Helper allowing you to return to previous actions.

**Bugs fixed**
- [#1009](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/pull/1009) Fixed an [error]((https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/issues/804)) on automatic discovery of Sentinel databases.
- [#978](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/pull/978) Work with [non-printable characters](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/issues/873). To avoid data loss, when non-printable characters are detected, key and value are editable in Workbench and CLI only.
