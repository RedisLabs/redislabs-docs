RedisInsight Profiler runs Redis ```MONITOR``` command, which analyzes every command sent to the redis instance. It parses the output of the MONITOR command and generates a summarized view. All the commands sent to the redis instance will be monitored for the duration of the profiling.

Profiler gives information about the number of commands processed, commands/second and number of connected clients. It also gives information about top prefixes, top keys and top commands.

**Start profiling** - Starts the profiling.

**Stop Profiling** - Stops the profiler i.e. the monitor command.

**Note**: Running monitor command is dangerous to the performance of your production server, hence the profiler is run for a maximum time of 5 minutes, if the user has not stopped it in between. This is to avoid overload on the server.
