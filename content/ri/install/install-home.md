We offer various ways to install RedisInsight:

- [Mac](/docs/install/mac/)
- [Linux](/docs/install/linux/)
- [Docker](/docs/install/docker/)
- [EC2](/docs/install/ec2/)
- [AWS CloudFormation](/docs/install/cloudformation/)
<!-- - AWS Marketplace -->

After you install RedisInsight you'll need to [activate](/docs/install/activating/) it to start using RedisInsight, unless you purchaced it through the AWS Marketplace. If you purchased RedisInsight through the AWS marketplace, you are already using a fully activated version of RedisInsight and no further activation is required.
