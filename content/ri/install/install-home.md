We offer various ways to install RedisInsight:

- [Mac]({{< relref "/ri/install/install-mac.md" >}})
- [Linux]({{< relref "/ri/install/install-linux.md" >}})
- [Docker]({{< relref "/ri/install/install-docker.md" >}})
- [EC2]({{< relref "/ri/install/install-ec2.md" >}})
- [AWS CloudFormation]({{< relref "/ri/install/install-cloudformation.md" >}})
<!-- - AWS Marketplace -->

After you install RedisInsight you'll need to [activate]({{< relref "/ri/install/activating-rdbtools.md" >}}) it to start using RedisInsight, unless you purchaced it through the AWS Marketplace. If you purchased RedisInsight through the AWS marketplace, you are already using a fully activated version of RedisInsight and no further activation is required.
