Redis 4.0 is the latest version that has been launched. It contains various big improvements compared to the previous versions.

1. It supports mixed RDB+AOF Format.
1. Improvement in memory usage and performance.
1. New **Memory** Command has been introduced.
1. Active Memory Defragmentation.
1. Faster Redis Cluster key creation.

## Trade Offs

Redis 4.0 is still not a stable release but is a very battle tested release, so Redis 3.2 is a better pick for critical applications till Redis 4.0 matures more in next few months.
