RedisInsight is a free GUI that is available on all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, and Docker) and works with all variants of Redis. RedisInsight allows you to:
- View data structures visually or use commands with a REPL (read-eval-print-loop)
- Analyze memory usage
- Perform bulk operations like renaming, expiring, and deleting
- Manage basic properties of your cluster such as cluster node timeout, IP, or port
- View the slow log to identify and troubleshoot bottlenecks

RedisInsight also has support for several Redis modules, including RedisGraph, RedisTimeSeries, and RediSearch.
