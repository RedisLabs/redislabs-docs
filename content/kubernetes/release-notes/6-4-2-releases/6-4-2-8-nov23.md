## Overview

This is a maintenance release of Redis Enterprise for Kubernetes version 6.4.2-8 and includes an updated Redis Enterprise image.

## New in this release

### Feature enhancements

* New Redis Enterprise software version 6.4.2-103

## Upgrade considerations

Be aware the following changes included in this release affect the upgrade process. Please read carefully before upgrading to 6.4.2-8.

* **Upgrade path to versions 7.2.4-2 or later**

  Upgrading from this version 7.2.4-2 or later is not possible using the OpenShift Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). OLM users will need to uninstall this version and do a fresh install of 7.2 versions.

* **ValidatingWebhookConfiguration**

  This release uses a new `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` resource to replace the `redb-admission` webhook resource. To use releases 6.4.2-4 or later, delete the old webhook resource and apply the new file. See [upgrade Redis cluster]({{<relref "/kubernetes/upgrade/upgrade-redis-cluster#reapply-webhook">}}) for instructions.

* **OpenShift SCC**

  This release includes a new SCC (`redis-enterprise-scc-v2`) that you need to bind to your service account before upgrading. OpenShift clusters running version 6.2.12 or earlier upgrading to version 6.2.18 or later might get stuck if you skip this step. See [upgrade a Redis Enterprise cluster (REC)]({{<relref "/kubernetes/upgrade/upgrade-redis-cluster#before-upgrading">}}) for expand.
