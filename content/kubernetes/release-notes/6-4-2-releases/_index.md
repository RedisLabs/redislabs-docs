{{<note>}}
On clusters with more than 9 REC nodes, a Kubernetes upgrade can render the Redis cluster unresponsive in some cases. A fix is available in the 6.4.2-5 release. Upgrade your Redis cluster to [6.4.2-5]({{<relref "/kubernetes/release-notes/6-4-2-releases/6-4-2-5.md">}}) before upgrading your Kubernetes cluster.
