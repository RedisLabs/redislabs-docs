* **Operator**: `redislabs/operator:6.4.2-4`
* **Services Rigger**: `redislabs/k8s-controller:6.4.2-4`

### OpenShift images

* **Redis Enterprise**: `registry.connect.redhat.com/redislabs/redis-enterprise:6.4.2-43.rhel8-openshift`

* **Operator**: `registry.connect.redhat.com/redislabs/redis-enterprise-operator:6.4.2-4`s
* **Services Rigger**: `registry.connect.redhat.com/redislabs/services-manager:6.4.2-4`

### OpenShift OLM bundles

## Upgrade to 6.4.2-4

This release uses a new `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` resource that replaces the old webhook resource. To use the 6.4.2-4 release, delete the old webhook resource and apply the new file.

1. Delete the existing `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` on the Kubernetes cluster (named `redb-admission`).

    ```sh
    kubectl delete ValidatingWebhookConfiguration redb-admission
    ```

1. Apply the resource from the new file.

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f deploy/admission/webhook.yaml
    ```

## New features

* Cluster-level LDAP configuration support in REC (RED-83533)
* Public preview support for declarative Active-Active configuration (RED-86470)(RED-86470)

## Feature improvements

* New labeling method for multi-namespace REDB (RED-83102)
* Operator deployment uses built-in SCC in OpenShift (RED-90524)
* Support for Redis Enterprise 6.4.2-43
* Support added for K8s 1.26, EKS 1.24, AKS 1.25, Rancher 2.7/1.23-24
* Improved log collector display and error handling

## Bug fixes

* Deployment manifests referenced non-existent redis-enterprise-admission ServiceAccount (RED-90469)
* CVE-2022-1996 (RED-93026)
* CVE-2022-28948 (RED-93027)

* CVE-2018-20225

## API changes

The following fields were changed in the [Redis Enterprise cluster (REC) API](https://github.com/RedisLabs/redis-enterprise-k8s-docs/blob/master/redis_enterprise_cluster_api.md):

* Added `.spec.ldap` for configuring cluster-level LDAP settings
* Added `.spec.certificates.ldapClientCertificateSecretName` for configuring LDAP client certificate
* Added `.status.managedAPIs` to track APIs managed by the operator

* The following custom resources definitions were added:
  * `RedisEnterpriseRemoteCluster` (RERC)
  * `RedisEnterpriseActiveActiveDatabase` (REAADB)

## Compatibility notes

### Deprecated features

* Support for Gesher, the advanced admission control configuration, is deprecated.
* The `app.redislabs.com/v1alpha1` API version of the RedisEnterpriseCluster (REC) custom resource is deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent release. Customers should switch to use the `app.redislabs.com/v1` API version instead.

\* Support added in this release

## Known limitations

* Long cluster names cause routes to be rejected  (RED-25871)

  A cluster name longer than 20 characters will result in a rejected route configuration because the host part of the domain name will exceed 63 characters. The workaround is to limit the cluster name to 20 characters or fewer.

* Cluster CR (REC) errors are not reported after invalid updates (RED-25542)
  
  A cluster CR specification error is not reported if two or more invalid CR resources are updated in sequence.

* An unreachable cluster has status running (RED-32805)
  
  When a cluster is in unreachable state, the state remains `running` instead of triggering an error.

* Readiness probe incorrect on failures (RED-39300)

  STS Readiness probe does not mark a node as "not ready" when running `rladmin status` on node failure.

* Internal DNS and Kubernetes DNS may have conflicts (RED-37462)

  DNS conflicts are possible between the cluster `mdns_server` and the K8s DNS. This only impacts DNS resolution from within cluster nodes for Kubernetes DNS names.

* 5.4.10 negatively impacts 5.4.6 (RED-37233)

  Kubernetes-based 5.4.10 deployments seem to negatively impact existing 5.4.6 deployments that share a Kubernetes cluster.

* Node CPU usage is reported instead of pod CPU usage (RED-36884)

  In Kubernetes, the reported node CPU usage is the usage of the Kubernetes worker node hosting the REC pod.

* Clusters must be named "rec" in OLM-based deployments (RED-39825)

  In OLM-deployed operators, the deployment of the cluster will fail if the name is not "rec". When the operator is deployed via the OLM, the security context constraints (scc) are bound to a specific service account name (namely, "rec"). The workaround is to name the cluster "rec".

* REC clusters fail to start on Kubernetes clusters with unsynchronized clocks (RED-47254)

  When REC clusters are deployed on Kubernetes clusters with unsynchronized clocks, the REC cluster does not start correctly. The fix is to use NTP to synchronize the underlying K8s nodes.

* Deleting an OpenShift project with an REC deployed may hang (RED-47192)

  When an REC cluster is deployed in a project (namespace) and has REDB resources, the REDB resources must be deleted first before the REC can be deleted. Therefore, until the REDB resources are deleted, the project deletion will hang. The fix is to delete the REDB resources first and the REC second. Then, you can delete the project.

* Hashicorp Vault integration - no support for Gesher (RED-55080)

  There is no workaround at this time.

* REC might report error states on initial startup (RED-61707)

  There is no workaround at this time except to ignore the errors.

* PVC size issues when using decimal value in spec (RED-62132)

  The workaround for this issue is to make sure you use integer values for the PVC size.

* Following old revision of quick start guide causes issues creating an REDB due to unrecognized memory field name (RED-69515)

  The workaround is to use the newer (current) revision of the [quick start]({{<relref "/kubernetes/deployment/quick-start.md">}}).

* `autoUpgrade` set to `true` can cause unexpected bdb upgrades when `redisUpgradePolicy` is set to `true` (RED-72351)

  Contact support if your deployment is impacted.
