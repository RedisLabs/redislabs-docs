Learn how to diagnose common problems during installation and runtime of Redis Data Integration (RDI).

## Problems during installation

### Problems with pip

Problems with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installation can occur because of the following reasons:

- **Wrong Python 3 version**

  In many Linux distributions, the Python 3 version is still 3.6. You can check this by running: `python --version`. You want version 3.7 or greater.

- **More than one Python 3 version installed**

  To solve this problem, create a Python virtual environment (venv) specifying
  the path to the appropriate Python 3 installation. For example, `<PATH>/python3.8 -m venv <VENV-NAME>`. If you are not sure about the path run `which python3` and copy the path pointing to a Python installation with a version of `3.7` or greater.

- **Outdated pip version**

  Some old pip versions can have problems with the wheel filename. It is best to update pip as well. In you `venv` run `pip install --upgrade pip`.

- **Old RDI CLI libraries from previous installations**

  Sometimes RDI CLI libraries or its dependencies are already installed and they need an upgrade to get the latest version:

  ```bash
  # outputs the list of installed packages
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  # updates all packages
  pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
  ```

### Problems with the `create` command

The following problems can occur when running the `create` command:

- **No network access to the Redis Enterprise API**
  - Verify your CLI host can resolve the DNS entry you use (if applicable) `dig <HOSTNAME>`.
  - Verify you have access to the specified ip:port `telnet <IP ADDRESS OF SERVER PC> <PORT>`.
  - 
- **Using a Redis Enterprise user with the wrong role**

  Users must have roles of either `DB Member`, `Cluster Member`, or `Admin`.

- **Trying to connect to the RDI database without an Ingress Controller path**

  When running Redis Enterprise on Kubernetes, each Redis database has a service that is created only after the database has been created. To connect with the CLI from outside of Kubernetes and configure the RDI database, you need an `Ingress` resource for your RDI database and `Ingress Controller` running on the Kubernetes cluster.

  A Kubernetes `Service` and `Ingress` are mutually exclusive. So if your database has a `Service` you should remove it and add an `Ingress` resource. Read [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) for more information.
  Alternatively, run the CLI within the Kubernetes cluster as described in [Running on Kubernetes]({{<relref "/rdi/installation/install-k8s">}}).

## Problems running Debezium

Set the log level to `DEBUG` to get more detailed information that would be useful in diagnosing unexpected behavior.

In the `application.properties` configuration file, add or modify:

```properties
quarkus.log.level=DEBUG
```

The most common problems with running Debezium Server are:

- **Debezium failing to reach the configuration file**

  The error message for this one is not clear, and typically Debezium reports it couldn't find the first element in the configuration file. Usually it implies there is no `application.properties` file in `$PWD/debezium`. Make sure you run the `docker run` command from the correct directory.

- **Debezium failing to reach the source database**

  The error message for this situation is also not obvious. Debezium will typically report a problem with reading the binary log of the source database. There are several potential reasons here:

  - The database is not configured to accept external connections. Consult the database specific Debezium documentation:
    - [MySQL/MariaDB](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/mysql.html#setting-up-mysql)
    - [Oracle](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/oracle.html#setting-up-oracle)
    - [PostgreSQL](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html#setting-up-postgresql)
    - [SQL Server](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/sqlserver.html#setting-up-sqlserver)
  - There is a local firewall on the Debezium/Database host, or a firewall rule on the subnet. Because you can not run `telnet <DB_HOST> <DB_PORT>` from the Debezium container, run it from the host. Check the following links to learn how to configure different databases to accept external connections:
    - [MySQL/MariaDB](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-allow-remote-access-to-mysql)
    - [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17781_01/server.112/e18804/network.htm#ADMQS156)
    - [PostgreSQL](https://tecadmin.net/postgresql-allow-remote-connections/)
    - [SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-remote-access-server-configuration-option?view=sql-server-ver16)

- **Handling a Debezium container crash**

  The Debezium Server is stateless. In case it crashes, you can always remove it safely and run a new one using a fixed `application.properties` file:

  - Check the status of the Debezium Server container:

    run `docker ps -a` to show all existing containers on the host.

  - If there is a Debezium Server container that has exited, you can remove it using `docker rm -f <DEBEZIUM_CONTAINER_ID>`.

- **Stopping and starting Debezium Server**

  In case you want to fix something in the Debezium Server configuration and Debezium Server is still running:

  - Use `docker stop <DEBEZIUM_CONTAINER_NAME>`.
  - You can start it later using `docker start <DEBEZIUM_CONTAINER_NAME>`. If You want the container to be attached to the terminal, run it with `--attach`.

## Getting Debezium Server logs

### Containerized deployment

- To follow the Debezium Server log output, run:

  ```bash
  docker logs <DEBEZIUM_CONTAINER_NAME> --follow
  ```

- To get the last `COUNT` lines of the Debezium Server log, run:

  ```bash
  docker logs <DEBEZIUM_CONTAINER_NAME> -n <COUNT>
  ```

- To get the log messages generated after a given timestamp, run:

  ```bash
  docker logs <DEBEZIUM_CONTAINER_NAME> --since <TIMESTAMP>
  ```

- To get the log messages issued before a given timestamp, run:

  ```bash
  docker logs <DEBEZIUM_CONTAINER_NAME> --until <TIMESTAMP>
  ```

> Note: For the format of the `TIMESTAMP` argument, see the [Docker logs documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/).

#### Examples

- Get the log messages generated after `2023-01-23T10:10:27Z`:

  ```bash
  docker logs --since 2023-01-23T10:10:27Z <DEBEZIUM_CONTAINER_NAME>
  ```

- Get the log messages generated before `2023-01-23T12:55:37Z`:

  ```bash
  docker logs --until  2023-01-23T12:55:37Z <DEBEZIUM_CONTAINER_NAME>
  ```

- Get the log messages generated in the last `50` minutes:

  ```bash
  docker logs --since=50m <DEBEZIUM_CONTAINER_NAME>
  ```

### Redirecting output to a file

If you want to save the log output in a file, add `| tee <LOG_FILE_PATH>` to the docker logs command. For example:

```bash
docker logs <DEBEZIUM_CONTAINER_NAME> -n 10 | tee /home/debezium-server/logs/debezium.log
```

> The last 10 lines of the Debezium Server log will be redirected to standard output and to the file `/home/debezium-server/logs/debezium.log`.

### Non-containerized deployment

The Debezium log files will be created in the directory set for the property `<quarkus.log.file.path>`.

#### Example

```properties
quarkus.log.file.path=/home/debezium-server/logs/debezium.log
quarkus.log.file.rotation.max-file-size=100M
quarkus.log.file.rotation.file-suffix=.yyyy-MM-dd.gz
quarkus.log.file.rotation.max-backup-index=3
quarkus.log.file.rotation.rotate-on-boot=true
```

With this configuration: 

* A `debezium.log` file is created in the directory `/home/debezium-server/logs/`.
* When the log file size reaches 100M it is renamed to `debezium.log.2023-01-22.1.gz`, and a new log file, `debezium.log`, is created.
* If the size of the log file reaches 100M and there are already 3 backup log files, the first backup file, `debezium.log.2023-01-22.1.gz`, is deleted.
* At any point in time, only four log files exist. Three backup log files: `debezium.log.2023-01-22.1.gz`, `debezium.log.2023-01-22.2.gz`, `debezium.log.2023-01-22.3.gz`, and one active log file, `debezium.log`.
