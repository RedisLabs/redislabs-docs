RDI Engine accumulates operating statistics that you can:

- Observe and analyze to discover various types of problems.
- Use for optimization purposes.

## Console metrics

RDI can display its operating metrics in the console using the [`redis-di status`]({{<relref "/rdi/reference/cli/redis-di-status">}}) command. The command provides information about the current RDI Engine status, target database configuration and processing statistics broken down by stream. This tool is intended to be used by an Operator to get the current snapshot of the system as well as the ongoing data processing monitoring (when used in live mode).

## Prometheus integration

RDI allows collecting and exporting its metrics to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and visualizing them in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). Operator can start the built-in exporter using the [`redis-di monitor`]({{<relref "/rdi/reference/cli/redis-di-monitor">}}) command. The diagram below describes this flow and components involved.

> Note: The host names and ports above are examples only and can be changed as needed.

### Test RDI metrics exporter

Start the RDI metrics exporter using the command below:

```bash
redis-di monitor
```

> Note: The default port for the exporter is `9121`. If you need to change it, use the `--exporter-port` option. The default metrics collection interval is 5 seconds. If you need to change it, use the `--collect-interval` option.

Then navigate to `http://localhost:9121/` to see the exported metrics. You should be able to see the following metric:

```
rdi_engine_state{state="RUNNING",sync_mode="UNKNOWN"} 1.0
```

> Note: The actual value of the metric above can be 0, if you haven't started RDI Engine yet (in which case, the `state` label should indicate that as well). You must have the RDI database created and configured before observing any metrics. If you are not seeing it or getting an error value instead, this indicates that the RDI database is not properly configured.

## Configure Prometheus

Next, configure the Prometheus scraper. Edit the `prometheus.yml` file to add the following scraper config:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  # scrape RDI metrics exporter
  - job_name: rdi-exporter
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["redis-exporter:9121"]
```

> Note: Make sure the `targets` value above points to the host and port you configured to run the RDI metrics exporter.
> Note: The scrape_interval setting in Prometheus should be the same or more than the collect_interval setting for the exporter. For example, if the collect_interval is set to 5 seconds, the scrape_interval should also be set to 5 seconds or more. If the scrape_interval is set to less than the collect_interval, Prometheus will scrape the exporter before it has a chance to collect and refresh metrics, and you will see the same values duplicated in Prometheus.

### Test Prometheus scraper

After the scraper config is added to the Prometheus configuration, you should now be able to navigate to `http://<HOSTNAME>:9090/graph` (replace `<HOSTNAME>` with a valid Prometheus hostname or IP address).
Explore RDI metrics using the [expression browser](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/browser/).

In the expression box, type in a metric name (for example, `rdi_engine_state`) and select `Enter` or the `Execute` button to see the following result:

```
rdi_engine_state{instance="redis-exporter:9121", job="rdi-exporter", status="RUNNING", sync_mode="UNKNOWN"} 1
```

> Note: You may see more than just one RDI metric, if RDI Engine has already processed any data. If you do not see any metrics please check your scraper job configuration in Prometheus.

## Use Grafana to analyze metrics

Optionally, you may deploy the sample Grafana dashboard to monitor the status of RDI Engine and its individual jobs. Follow these steps to import the dashboard:

1. Download the **dashboard file** to your local machine.

1. Log into Grafana and navigate to the list of dashboards, then choose **New -> Import**:

1. On the next screen, select **Upload JSON file** and upload the file you downloaded in step 1. Make sure you select the data source that is connected to the RDI metrics exporter:

1. Select **Import** and make sure you choose the jobs to monitor in a drop-down list (this will be empty if you don't have any jobs running yet):

## RDI metrics

This list shows exported RDI metrics along with their descriptions:

Indicates the time in milliseconds the first available record has spent in the stream waiting to be processed by RDI Engine. If no records pending it will always return zero. |
