This reference document is following the original [Debezium documentation](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/operations/debezium-server.html). It explains how to use Debezium Server's configuration file named `application.properties` to configure Debezium Server.
You will find similar explanations inside the `application.properties` file generated by the `scaffold` command:

```bash
redis-di scaffold <NAME> --db-type <mysql|oracle|postgresql|sqlserver>
```

## Target (Sink) Connector

The target connector is [Redis](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/operations/debezium-server.html#_redis_stream).

### Basic Configuration

```properties
debezium.sink.type=redis
debezium.sink.redis.address=<REDIS_DI_BDB_HOST>:12001
debezium.sink.redis.password=<REDIS_DI_PASSWORD>
```

| debezium.sink.type                         |         | Must be set to redis.                                                                                                                                                        |
| debezium.sink.redis.address                |         | An address, formatted as host:port, at which the Redis target streams are provided.                                                                                          |

| debezium.sink.redis.password               |         | (Optional) A password (of respective user) used to communicate with Redis. A password must be set if a user is set.                                                          |
| debezium.sink.redis.ssl.enabled            | false   | (Optional) Use SSL to communicate with Redis.                                                                                                                                |
| debezium.sink.redis.null.key               |         | Redis does not support the notion of data without key, so this string will be used as key for records without primary key.                                                   |
| debezium.sink.redis.null.value             |         | Redis does not support the notion of null payloads, as is the case with tombstone events. This string will be used as value for records without a payload.                   |
| debezium.sink.redis.batch.size             | 500     | Number of change records to insert in a single batch write (Pipelined transaction).                                                                                          |
| debezium.sink.redis.retry.initial.delay.ms | 300     | Initial retry delay when encountering Redis connection or OOM issues. This value will be doubled upon every retry but won’t exceed `debezium.sink.redis.retry.max.delay.ms`. |
| debezium.sink.redis.retry.max.delay.ms     | 10000   | Max delay when encountering Redis connection or OOM issues.                                                                                                                  |

## Source (Database) Connector

The source connector depends on the database you get data from. The basic configurations are the same for all database type except for the connector class.

### Essential Source Properties

> Note: Add `debezium.source.` prefix to the listed properties when using in `application.properties`.

### Debezium Connectors for Various Databases

For additional properties consult Debezium documentation for a specific connector:

- [Cassandra](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/cassandra.html)
- [MySQL/MariaDB](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/mysql.html)
- [Oracle](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/oracle.html)
- [PostgreSQL](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html)
- [SQL Server](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/sqlserver.html)

## Using Queries in Initial Snapshot

- In case you want a snapshot to include only a subset of the rows in a table, you need to add the property `debezium.source.snapshot.select.statement.overrides` and add a comma-separated list of fully-qualified table names in the form of `<databaseName>.<tableName>`.

- For each table in the list, add a further configuration property that specifies the `SELECT` statement for the connector to run on the table when it takes a snapshot. The specified `SELECT` statement determines the subset of table rows to include in the snapshot. Use the following format to specify the name of this `SELECT` statement property: `snapshot.select.statement.overrides.<databaseName><tableName>`.

- Add a comma-separated list of fully-qualified column names that are included in the `SELECT` statement:
  `debezium.source.column.include.list = <databaseName>.<tableName>.<columnName1>,<databaseName>.<tableName>.<columnName2>,<databaseName>.<tableName>.<columnName>...`

- In case you want to include all the table columns in the `SELECT` statement, you can use regular expression in the form of `<databaseName>.<tableName>.*` instead of adding each one of the table columns to `debezium.source.column.include.list` property.

### Notes

- The tables that are defined in the property `debezium.source.snapshot.select.statement.overrides` should be added to the property `debezium.source.table.include.list` in the form of `<databaseName>.<tableName>`.

- The `SELECT` statement should include all the columns that compose the primary key of the table.

### Example

To select the columns `CustomerId`, `FirstName` and `LastName` from `customer` table and join it with `invoice` table in order to get customers with total invoices greater than 8000, we need to add the following properties to the `application.properties` file:

```properties
debezium.source.table.include.list = chinook.customer

debezium.source.column.include.list = chinook.customer.CustomerID,chinook.customer.FirstName,chinook.customer.LastName

debezium.source.snapshot.select.statement.overrides=chinook.customer

debezium.source.snapshot.select.statement.overrides.chinook.customer = SELECT c.CustomerId, c.FirstName, c.LastName \
FROM chinook.customer c INNER JOIN chinook.invoice inv \
ON c.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId  \
WHERE inv.total > 8000
```

## Form Custom Message Keys(s) for Change Event Records

- By default, Debezium uses the primary key column(s) of a table as the message key for records that it emits.
  In place of the default, or to specify a key for tables that lack a primary key, you can configure custom message keys based on one or more columns.

- To establish a custom message key for a table, list the table followed by the column to use as the message key.
  Each list entry takes the following format:

  ```properties
  debezium.source.message.key.columns=<databaseName>.<tableName>:<columnName>
  ```

- To base a table key on multiple column names, insert commas between the columns names:

  ```properties
  debezium.source.message.key.columns=<databaseName>.<tableName>:<columnName1>,<columnName2>...
  ```

- The property can include entries for multiple tables. Use a semicolon to separate table entries in the list:

  ```properties
  debezium.source.message.key.columns=<databaseName>.<tableName1>:<columnName1>,<columnName2>;<databaseName>:<tableName>:<columnName1>,<columnName2>
  ```

### Fully-qualified Table Name

In this document we refer to the fully-qualified table name as `<databaseName>.<tableName>`. This format is for MySQL database. For Oracle, SQLServer and Postgresql databases use `<schemaName>`.`<tableName>` instead.

| Database Type                  | Fully-qualified Table Name   |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Oracle, SQLServer, PostrgreSQL | `<schemaName>.<tableName>`   |
| MySQL                          | `<databaseName>.<tableName>` |

### Notes

- You can specify the fully-qualified table name `<databaseName>.<tableName>` as a regular expression instead of providing the full name of the `databaseName` and `tableName`.
- There is no limit to the number of columns that can be used to create custom message keys. However, it’s best to use the minimum required number of columns to specify a unique key.

### Examples

- The primary key of the tables `customer` and `employee` is `CustomerID`.

  To establish custom messages keys based on `FirstName` and `LastName` for the tables `customer` and `employee`, add the following property to the `application.properties` file:

  ```properties
  debezium.source.database.message.key.columns=chinook.customer:FirstName,LastName;chinook.employee:FirstName,LastName
  ```

- To specify the columns `FirstName` and `LastName` as the message keys for the table `chinook.customer` in **any** database add the following property to the `application.properties` file:

  ```properties
  chinook.customer:FirstName,LastName;(.*).employee:FirstName,LastName
  ```
