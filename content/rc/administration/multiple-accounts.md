You can be a member of multiple accounts in Redis Cloud.
For example, if you created your own account and your company has arranged its subscriptions into multiple accounts (Dev,
Test, and Prod) that you are a member of.

The console admin menu includes a drop-down menu that lists your current Redis Enterprise Cloud account memberships.

When you first sign into the admin console, you're connected to the first account registered with your email address.

Use the drop-down arrow to display additional Redis Enterprise accounts.  To switch to a different account, select it from this list.  When you do this, the admin console shows the resources associated with the selected subscription.

The permissions for each account are defined by the role you are assigned by the account owner.
