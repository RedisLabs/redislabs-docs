To view your database, go to the Menu and click on "Databases".
Your databases are grouped by [subscription]({{< relref "/rc/administration/setup/create-subscription.md" >}}).

![Viewing databases in UI](/images/rcpro/databases_main.png)

In this view you see the each database and some of its settings.
Since a [subscription]({{< relref "/rc/administration/setup/create-subscription.md" >}}) can have multiple databases,
you can add one to a subscription by clicking on the **+** below each subscription table.

When you select a database you can:

- Click ![Edit](/images/rcpro/icon_edit.png#no-click "Edit") to [edit the database](#edit-a-database).
    You can change the [database settings]({{< relref "/rc/administration/setup/create-database.md" >}}).
- Click the trash can to delete the database.
- Click the arrow to [import data]({{< relref "/rc/how-to/importing-data.md" >}}) into the database.
- Click the clock to [backup the database]({{< relref "/rc/administration/configuration/backups.md" >}}) if backups are already configured.

Here is a video that shows how to edit a database:
