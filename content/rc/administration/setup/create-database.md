Once you have a subscription, you can easily create a database in Redis Cloud by following these steps:

1. In the Redis Cloud menu, click **Databases**.
1. In the subscription where you want to add the database, click ![Add](/images/rs/icon_add.png#no-click "Add").
1. Configure the database:
    - **Name** - Enter a name for the database. (Up to 40 characters long)
    - **Protocol** - Select whether the database uses **Redis** or **Memcached**.
    - **Memory** - Enter a memory limit for the database. If replication is on, the database limit includes the memory of the slave shards.
    - **Redis on Flash** - If your database uses [Redis on Flash]({{< relref "/rs/concepts/memory-architecture/redis-flash.md" >}}),
        enter the average data structure size (in bytes). This helps us optimize your database.
    - **Throughput** - In **Throughput by**, select the definition of throughput as:
        - Ops/sec - Enter the required **Max Throughput** between 1000 and 10000000.
        - Shards - Enter the number of **Shards** you require for the database.
    - **Replication** - By default, each shard has a slave shard.
        If you do not require slave shards, disable replication.
    - **Data Persistence** - Select when and how the data is saved to [persistent storage]({{< relref "rc/concepts/data-persistence.md" >}}) :
        - None - Data is not persisted to disk at all.
        - Append Only File (AoF) one second - Data is fsynced to disk every second.
        - Snapshot every 1 hour - A snapshot of the database is created every hour.
        - Snapshot every 6 hours - A snapshot of the database is created every 6 hours.
        - Snapshot every 12 hours - A snapshot of the database is created every 12 hours.
    - **OSS Cluster API** - You can:
        - Enable [OSS Cluster API]({{< relref "/rs/concepts/data-access/oss-cluster-api.md" >}})
            to expose the cluster topology to your application.
        - Select **Use external endpoint** to let clients connect to the OSS cluster API throught the external endpoint.
    - **Replica Of** - You can enable [Replica Of]({{< relref "/rs/administering/designing-production/active-passive.md" >}})
        and select the endpoint of a database to hold a copy of the data.

        {{< note >}}
You must configure [VPC Peering]({{< relref "/rc/administration/setup/edit-subscription#vpc-peering" >}})
between the VPC that this database is on and the VPC that the destination database is on.
        {{< /note >}}

    - [**Access Control & Security**]({{< relref "/rs/administering/designing-production/security/client-connections.md" >}}) - You can:
        - Enable the **Default User** for the database.
            We recommend that you use a complex password and not leave the password blank.
        - Specify the **Source IP/Subnet** addresses that your database receives
            traffic from, for example your application server.
        - Enable **SSL Client Authentication**, and either:
            - **Generate Client Certificate** and configure your client to use
                the generated certificate.
            - Paste the certificate for your client.
    - **Data Eviction Policy** - Select a policy for evicting data when the memory limit is reached.
    - **Periodic Backups** - Enable backups and specify the [database backup]({{< relref "/rc/administration/configuration/backups.md" >}}) location.
    - **Modules** - Enable modules and select the module to use with the database.

        - For applications that require high-throughput, use a Redis Cloud Pro subscription.
        - For RedisGraph, use the [sizing calculator](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise/redis-graph/redisgraph-calculator/)
            to calculate the required resources.
        - For RediSearch on a Redis Cloud Pro subscription, enter the estimated number of documents you want to index.

    - **Alert Settings** - Select the alerts that you want sent to you and your team when the specified threshold is exceeded.
1. Click **Activate**.

After you click **Activate**, Redis Cloud:

- Calculates the number of shards needed for this database.
- Calculate if is enough space to fit the database in the current infrastructure
    or if you must increase the cloud resources.
- Checks that you have enough unused shards in your subscription.

If a new infrastructure needs to be deployed, or more shards need to be
purchased, Redis Cloud shows you the additional instances/shards that you need for this
database and the cost of the additional resources. You can review this information
and approve the additional resources. After you approve, Redis Cloud activates the resources.

When activation is completed, creates the database. During this process you can see:

- An orange spinning icon on the top right to turn to a green checkmark
- The **Endpoint** of the new database
