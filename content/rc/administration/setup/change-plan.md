You can change your subscription plan at any time.

To do so:

1. From the Redis Cloud menu, choose **Subscriptions**.  

    ![Select **Subscriptions** from the Redis Cloud menu](/images/rc/subscription-menu-select.png)

1.  Select the subscription you want to change.

    ![Select the target subscription from the list](/images/rc/subscription-list-select.png)

1.  Select the **Change Subscription** button to list the available options.

1.  The first option you can change is type, which indicates whether the plan supports replication or data-persistence.  

    Your current selection is highlighted.

    To change this setting, select your preferred value.

1.  Available memory sizes are displayed, along with prices.  

    To change the memory size, choose your preferred value.

    If you are upgrading a free plan, you need to select or add a payment method.

1.  When finished, select the **Update** button.

Before updating to a plan with a smaller memory size, verify that your data fits the new size.  Otherwise, the update process will fail and the plan will remain at the original size.


Subscription updates happen in the background.  Changes may take several minutes to complete.  

If the **Change Subscription** button is disabled, it usually means earlier updates are still deploying.

Refresh the page after a few moments.  If the problem persists, contact support.
