Deleting a database is just as easy as creating one. Make sure that you
are truly done with the database as once you delete the database, it
cannot be recovered (except from your backups).

Note: Only users defined as Owners on the team can delete a database.

### Steps

1. Navigate to the "Databases" page from the Redis Cloud Essentials menu
1. Click on the database you wish to delete from the list of your
    databases.
1. Click on the trash can icon next to "View Database."
1. A window will pop up asking if you really want to delete your
    database. If so, click "Delete."
1. You will be taken back to the main Databases page. The database, all
    of its data, and configurations is now deleted.

Note: It is considered best practiceÂ that you [create a
backup]({{< relref "/rc/administration/configure/backups.md" >}}) of your
database before deleting it.
