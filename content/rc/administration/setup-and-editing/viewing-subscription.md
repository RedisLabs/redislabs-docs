and then click on the name of the Subscription you wish to view.

There three things you can change about an existing subscription:

1. The Redis Cloud Essentials plan

To change the first two, click on the pencil icon to the right of each.
To change the plan, click on "Change Subscription" button at the bottom
of the form. Go to Change a Subscription Plan to learn more.

To delete a subscription, click on the "Delete" button at the bottom of
the form. You will be prompted to confirm before the actual delete. The
delete will only occur if the subscription does not have any databases.
If it does, please delete the databases first.
