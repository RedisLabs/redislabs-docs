The security controls for your database are:

## Access control by source IP or subnet

The number of source IP rules that you can add depends on the Redis Cloud plan that you purchased.
For example, the 1GB plan allows up to 8 source IP authentication rules.
These rules can contain either IP or [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation).

In case you require more source IP rules than your current Redis Cloud plan entitles you to,
you can upgrade to [another plan](https://redislabs.com/pricing) that supports the number of source IP rules that you need.

You may change your subscription at any time by going to **Databases > Configuration > Edit > Access Control & Security**.

{{< note >}}
Only the account owner can change the subscription.

## Securing connections to your database with SSL/TLS

You can [secure your database connections]({{< relref "/rc/administration/security/securing-redis-cloud-connections.md" >}}) with SSL/TLS.

## Default user

The [default user]({{< relref "/rc/administration/setup/create-database.md" >}}) for your database, which is enabled by default,
requires all connections to the database to use the [AUTH command](https://redis.io/commands/auth) to authenticate with the default user password.
If you enable data access control, database connections can use any of the configured users.

You can click on ![icon_view](/images/rc/icon_view.png#no-click "View") to see the password in plain text.

## Data access control

You can [create users with ACLs]({{< relref "/rc/administration/security/data-access-control.md" >}}) that limit the commands and keys that each user can access for specific databases.
When your client authenticates with one of these users,
only the defined commands and keys are allowed.

## AWS Security groups

If you use AWS EC2 classic instance,
you can use the Group Name and the AWS Account ID to identify the security group and secure your database.
