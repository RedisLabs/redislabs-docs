- Standard support

Take advantage of the tremendous expertise of the team that develops
open source Redis and relieve your operations team of any hassle related
to managing and operating your mission-critical Redis deployments.

## Features

### Infinite and seamless scalability

Grow your dataset to any size needed (beyond the largest cloud instances)
without any downtime or limitation of Redis commands.
Upgrade or downgrade by simply changing plan settings,
without downtime and without the need to move your dataset between cloud instances.

With Redis Enterprise Cloud, we automatically add or remove instances to your cluster
to accommodate your fluctuating dataset size without any interruption
to your applications.

### Significant cost saving of Redis on Flash (RoF)

For datasets larger than 50GB,
running Redis on Flash delivers high throughput with the same sub-millisecond latencies of Redis on RAM,
while cutting the cost of your cloud resources by over 70%.

### True high availability

Achieve high availability for your Redis databases, with continuous operation and zero operational effort.
Redis adds proven technology to ensure high availability for Redis deployments,
safeguarding against all possible failure scenarios by using:

- Efficient, diskless, in-memory replication across multiple availability zones and regions
- Instant automatic failover
- Persistence with Append Only File (AOF) or snapshots
- Backups and disaster recovery

Redis Enterprise Cloud has demonstrated resilience over many years,
providing hundreds of thousands of databases with continuous operation while withstanding hundreds of cloud outages,
all without data loss or interruption of service.

### Predictable high performance

Take advantage of the best performance in the industry using Redis
Enterprise Technology that enhances Redis with numerous optimizations
and hosts your database on optimal cloud instances.

### Hybrid deployment and geo-region replication {#hybrid-deployment-and-georegion-replication}

Efficiently replicate Redis databases between Redis Enterprise Cloud and Redis Enterprise Software or across cloud regions,
with built-in compression and WAN optimization technologies.
Create multi-region, multi-cloud or hybrid (on-premises and cloud) Redis Enterprise deployments
that accelerate your applications and require zero time to recover.

### 24/7 Monitoring and support {#247-monitoring-and-support}

No need to manage instances, clusters, scaling, data persistence, high availability settings, and failure recovery.

### Multiple dedicated databases in one plan

Utilize multiple databases in a single plan,
each running in a dedicated process and in a non-blocking manner.

### Email alerts

Receive instant notifications when memory or connection limits are
exceeded, or latency, high throughput or low throughput thresholds are
crossed.

### Unlimited database connection

With high volume plans you can use as many database connections as you want.
