- Via [CloudFormation]({{<relref "cloudformation.md">}}) - the 'AWS native' automation tool. The simplest for those experienced with CloudFormation and perhaps the least error-prone of any of the methods. 
- Via [Terraform]({{<relref "terraform.md">}}) - this has the most extensive support for further automation within the Redis world (and is the fastest mechanism for creating these IAM resources).
- Via the [AWS Console]({{<relref "creating-aws-user-redis-enterprise-vpc.md">}}) - the mechanism requiring the least knowledge and experience.
