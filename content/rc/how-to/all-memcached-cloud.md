Follow the instructions below to use flush_all.

## flush_all for SASL protected Memcached Enterprise cloud databases

If your resource has SASL authentication enabled, you can't use nc
command or telnet to run flush_all on your Memcached Enterprise Cloud
resource. You have to download a Memcached CLI client that supports
SASL. We recommend to use the bmemcached-CLI client, and the
instructions here is for this client. This instruction refers to Ubuntu
OS. Please make the necessary changes if you are using other Linux
flavor.

```sh
$ wget https://github.com/RedisLabs/bmemcached-cli/archive/master.zip
$ sudo apt-get install unzip python-pip
$ unzip master.zip -d bmemcached-cli
$ cd bmemcached-cli/bmemcached-cli-master/
$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip
$ sudo pip install . -r requirements.pip
```

Now you can run the flush_all command using the bmemcached-cli. The
usage is simple:

```sh
bmemcached-cli [user]:[password]@[host]:[port]
```

usage example:

```sh
$ bmemcached-cli memcached-app123:x298k37@pub-memcache-1010.us-east-1-3.4.ec2.garantiadata.com:1010
([B]memcached) flush_all
True
exit
```

## flush_all for Memcached Enterprise cloud databases

```sh
$ telnet memcached-12345.c69.us-east-1-2.ec2.cloud.redislabs.com 12345
