It is possible for you to be a member of multiple accounts in Redis Cloud Essentials. For example, you created your own account, but your company has arranged its subscriptions into multiple accounts (Dev,
Test, and Prod) and you are members of each of those accounts. If this
is the case, when you open the Redis Cloud Essentials menu, you will see
a menu like the screenshot below. If you click on the little arrow, it
will show you all the accounts you are a member of and allow you to
quickly switch between each. The rights you have for each account are
dictated by the role you are assigned by each account's owner.
