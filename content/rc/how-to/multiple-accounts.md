You can be a member of multiple accounts in Redis Cloud.
For example, if you created your own account and your company has arranged its subscriptions into multiple accounts (Dev,
Test, and Prod) that you are a member of.

When you open the Redis Cloud menu, you see a menu like the screenshot below.
When you click on the arrow, you see all of the accounts you are a member of and you can switch between the accounts.
The permissions for each account are defined by the role you are assigned by the account owner.
