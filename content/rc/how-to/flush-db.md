There are times where you want to delete all database data. In previous
versions of Redis Enterprise Cloud, there was a button to perform this
for you in the web UI. As more and more people use Redis Enterprise
Cloud for their authoritative database, keeping that data safe is even
more critical. So this operation was removed from the web UI so people
did not accidentally hit it.

### flushall for Redis Enterprise Cloud Databases

If you would still like to perform this operation on your database, you
can, but it is from the command line using the redis-cli command or from
your favorite Redis client.

Here is how to do it using redis-cli:

```src
$ redis-cli -h <hostname> -p <portnumber> -a <password> flushall
```

Example:

```src
$ redis-cli -h redis-12345.c24.us-east-mz-1.ec2.cloud.redislabs.com -p 12345 -a xyz flushall
```

Remember that this will delete ALL of the data in the database. This
includes allÂ data in memory and persisted to disk. So before doing
flushall, it is best practice to [backup your
database]({{< relref "/rc/administration/configure/backups.md" >}}) first.

### Flushing Redis Enterprise Cloud CRDBs

When you flush a CRDB, multiple resources flush their data simultaneously.
To flush data from a CRDB, use the flush command in the crdb-cli.

1. To find the ID of the CRDB, run:

    ```src
    crdb-cli crdb list
    ```

1. To flush the CRDB, run:

    ```src
    crdb-cli crdb flush --crdb-guid <ID_of_the_CRDB>
    ```

To flush a CRDB with the REST API:

1. To find the ID of the CRDB, run:

    ```src
    curl -v -u <user>@<password> -X PUT https://<cluster-fqdn>:9443/v1/crdbs/
    ```

1. To flush the CRDB, run:

    ```src
    curl -v -u <username>:<password> -X PUT https://<cluster-fqdn>:9443/v1/crdbs/<guid>/flush
    ```

    The command output contains the GUID of the flush task.
1. To check the status of the flush task, run:

    ```src
    curl -v -u <username>:<password> https://<cluster-fqdn>:9443/v1/crdb_tasks/<task-id>
    ```
