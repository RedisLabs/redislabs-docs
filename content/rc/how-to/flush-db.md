There are times where you want to delete all database data.

{{% warning title="Data Loss Warning" %}} The flush command deletes ALL of the data in the database. This
includes allÂ data in memory and persisted to disk. We recommend that you
[backup your database]({{< relref "/rc/administration/configure/backups.md" >}}) first.{{% /warning %}}
