You can use `cURL` commands to create and manage a cloud account
with the [CURL HTTP client]({{< relref "/rc/api/how-to/using-curl#using-the-curl-http-client" >}}).

## Create a database

The API operation that creates a database is: `POST /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/databases`

The database is created in an existing or a newly created subscription.
When a subscription is created, it is created with at least one database.
You can add more databases to the subscription, and you can update or delete existing databases.

Creating a database is an [asynchronous operation]({{< relref "/rc/api/concepts/provisioning-lifecycle#asynchronous-operations" >}}).

The following Linux shell script sends a `POST /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/databases` and waits for a cloud account ID.
When the cloud account ID is received, the processing phase is complete and the provisioning phase starts.

### Prerequisites

- Install `jq` on your machine: `sudo apt install jq`
- Define the expected variables needed to use the API:

    ```shell
{{% embed-code "rv/api/06-set-variables-with-subscription-id.sh" %}}
    ```

### Database JSON body

The created database is defined by a JSON document that is sent as the body of the API request.

In the example below, that JSON document is stored in the `create-database-basic.json` file:

```shell
{{% embed-code "rv/api/create-database-basic.json" %}}
```

The JSON body contains only the most basic, required parameters in order to create a database:

- Database name - A unique name per subscription that can contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens
- Maximum database size in GB
- Database password

### Database creation script

You can run the **create database** script from the command line with: `bash path/script-name.sh`

Below is the sample script that you can use as a reference to call the API operation to create a database.

```shell
{{% embed-code "rv/api/11-create-database.sh" %}}
```

### Additional database parameters

There are many additional parameters and settings that can be defined on database creation:

- Review the database parameters and options in the [Swagger OpenAPI documentation](https://api.redislabs.com/v1/swagger-ui.html#/Databases).
- Select `POST Create database`.
- Under `Database definition`, click on the `Model` options.
