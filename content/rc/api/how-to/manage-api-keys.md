After you create a Redis Enterprise Cloud API access key, you can manage this access key in the following ways:

- Deleting the access key
- Limiting usage of the access key by network subnets

## Deleting an API access key

To delete an access key:

1. [Log in to admin console](https://app.redislabs.com) as an account owner.
1. Go to: **Settings** > **Cloud API Keys**

    If **Cloud API Keys** is not shown, make sure you have [enabled the API for your account]({{< relref "/rc/api/how-to/enable-your-account-to-use-api.md" >}})).
1. Click **Delete**.
1. Confirm that you want to delete the access key.

## Limit access by subnet

By default, API access is allowed from all IP addresses.

To limit API access to a specified range of source IP addresses:

1. [Log in to admin console](https://app.redislabs.com) as an account owner.
1. Go to: **Settings** > **Cloud API Keys**
1. Click **Manage IPs** for the access key that you want to limit.
1. Click ![Add](/images/rs/icon_add.png#no-click "Add") to add a new whitelist subnet.
1. Enter the subnet in [CIDR format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation), for example: `10.2.5.0/24`
1. Save the subnet.

After you add the subnet, you can add more subnets or click **OK**.

## Delete an allowed subnet

1. [Log in to admin console](https://app.redislabs.com) as an account owner.
1. Go to: **Settings** > **Cloud API Keys**
1. Click **Manage IPs** for the access key that you want to change.
1. Delete the subnet that you want to disallow.

After you delete the subnet, you can delete more subnets or click **OK**.
