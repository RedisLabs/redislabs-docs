## New features

### Network data cost breakdowns

Invoices for customers with Flexible and Annual subscriptions now include a breakdown of network data costs for the subscription. To download an invoice, go to the [Billing and Payments]({{<relref "/rc/billing-and-payments#download-invoice">}}) page on the [Redis Cloud console](https://app.redislabs.com/).

Customers with Annual subscriptions can also find a breakdown of network data costs in the consumption report.
