## New features

### Network data cost breakdowns

Invoices for customers with Flexible and Annual subscriptions now include a breakdown of network data costs for the subscription. To download an invoice, go to the [Billing and Payments]({{<relref "/rc/billing-and-payments#download-invoice">}}) page on the [Redis Cloud console](https://app.redislabs.com/).

Customers with Annual subscriptions can also find a breakdown of network data costs in the consumption report.

## Deprecations

- New and upgraded Fixed subscriptions are limited to one database per subscription. If you are on a legacy plan, you can add databases up to the plan limit. If you choose to upgrade your plan, you can keep your databases, but you will need to create a new subscription to add another database.
