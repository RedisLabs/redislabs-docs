For more information about Triggers and Functions, see the [Triggers and Functions documentation]().

## Deprecations

- RedisGraph is no longer available when you select Redis Stack on Fixed. For more information, see the [RedisGraph end of life announcement](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/).
