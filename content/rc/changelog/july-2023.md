This changelog lists new features, enhancements, and other changes added to Redis Enterprise Cloud during June 2023.

## New features

### Redis 7.2 flexible opt-in

You can opt in to Redis 7.2 on [Flexible subscriptions]({{<relref "/rc/subscriptions/create-flexible-subscription">}}). Redis 7.2 introduces several changes to existing Redis commands; see the [list of breaking changes]({{<relref "/rc/changelog/june-2023#redis-72-breaking-changes">}}) published in last month's changelog for more details.

### New ACL capabilities

You can now use [Selectors](https://redis.io/docs/management/security/acl/#selectors) and [Key Permissions](https://redis.io/docs/management/security/acl/#selectors) in your [ACL rules]({{<relref "rc/security/access-control/data-access-control/configure-acls">}}) for all Redis 7.2 databases. 

In addition, the admin console now returns an error if you try to enter an invalid ACL. It will also associate the ACL rule with the supported database version when you [add it to a role]({{<relref "rc/security/access-control/data-access-control/create-roles">}}).

## Deprecations

- RedisGraph is no longer available when you select Redis Stack on Fixed. For more information, see the [RedisGraph end of life announcement](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/).
