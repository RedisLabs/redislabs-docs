## New features

### SAML account linking tokens

The process for [linking new Redis accounts]({{<relref "/rc/security/access-control/saml-sso#link-other-accounts">}}) to your [SAML single sign-on]({{<relref "/rc/security/access-control/saml-sso">}}) configuration has changed to enhance security. Now, both accounts must use a token to ensure that the connection is legitimate.
