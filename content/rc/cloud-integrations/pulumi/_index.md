1.  Sign in to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).

If, for whatever reason, your AWS Marketplace account is disabled or otherwise unavailable, you won't be able to use your Flexible subscription until the billing method is updated.  For help, [contact support](https://redis.com/company/support/).
