After you have [created a knowledge base]({{< relref  "rc/cloud-integrations/aws-marketplace/aws-bedrock/create-knowledge-base" >}}), you can use it to create an agent on Amazon Bedrock.

Before you begin this guide, you will need:

- An [AWS IAM Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html) with [permissions for the Bedrock agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html).

- A [Bedrock knowledge base]({{< relref  "rc/cloud-integrations/aws-marketplace/aws-bedrock/create-knowledge-base" >}}) connected to a [Redis Cloud vector database]({{< relref  "rc/cloud-integrations/aws-marketplace/aws-bedrock/set-up-redis" >}}).

## Create an agent

1. Sign in to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/). 

1. Use the **Services** menu to locate and select **Machine Learning** > **Amazon Bedrock**.  This takes you to the Amazon Bedrock admin panel.

1. Select **Agents** > **Create Agent** to create your knowledge base.

1. In the **Agent name** section, enter a name and description for your agent.

1. Select whether or not you want the agent to be able to ask for additional information in the **User input** section.

1. Select the IAM role for the Bedrock agent in the **IAM Permissions** section. 

1. Choose how long you want your idle session timeout to be in the **Idle session timeout** section. Select **Next** to continue.

1. In the **Model details** section, choose which model you want to use and enter the instructions for your agent. Select **Next** to continue.

1. In the **Action groups** section, you may specify any tasks you would like the agent to perform. Select **Next** to continue.

1. Select the [knowledge base](#create-a-knowledge-base) you created and summarize the information in the knowledge base in the **Knowledge base instructions for Agent** form. Select **Add another knowledge base** if you would like to add multiple knowledge bases.

    Select **Next** to continue.

1. Review your agent before you create it. Select **Create Agent** to finish creation.

Amazon Bedrock will create your agent and link it to your knowledge base. This will take some time. 

Your agent will have a status of **Ready** when it is ready to be tested.
