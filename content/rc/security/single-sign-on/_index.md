As an alternative to the traditional email/password account authentication method, you can create a Redis Cloud account and sign in to the [admin console](https://app.redislabs.com/new/) with [single sign-on (SSO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on). This lets you use one set of credentials, managed by your [identity provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider), to access multiple websites.

## Supported SSO methods

- [SAML SSO]({{<relref "/rc/security/single-sign-on/saml-sso">}})
- [Social login]({{<relref "/rc/security/single-sign-on/social-login">}})
