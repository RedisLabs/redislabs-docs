Redis Cloud offers [social login](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_login) as a [single sign-on (SSO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) option. Social login lets you use an existing social media account to create or sign in to your Redis Cloud account.

Redis Cloud supports the following social logins:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Google](https://accounts.google.com/)

{{<note>}}
If your Google and GitHub accounts share an email address (such as Gmail), you can use either one to sign in to the same Redis Cloud account.

## Migrate an existing account to social login

If you already have a Redis Cloud account that requires an email address and password to sign in, you can migrate your existing account to use a social login associated with that same email address instead.

Once you migrate your account to use social login, you cannot revert to your old email/password sign in method.
