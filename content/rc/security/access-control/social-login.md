Redis Cloud supports the following social logins:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Google](https://accounts.google.com/)

{{<note>}}
If your Google and GitHub accounts share an email address (such as Gmail), you can use either one to sign in to the same Redis Cloud account.

## Create a new account with social login

To set up Google login:

1. Select **Google** from the [sign-in](https://app.redislabs.com/new/) screen.
1. Sign in with the Google account you would like to use.
1. Select **Confirm** on the **Sign in with Google** prompt.

To set up GitHub login:

1. Select **Github** from the [sign-in](https://app.redislabs.com/new/) screen.
2. Sign in with the Github account you would like to use.
3. Select **Authorize** on the **Authorize Redis Okta Auth Github** prompt.

{{<note>}}
If the email address associated with your GitHub account is not public, you will see an error message that your sign in attempt failed. You need to [make your email address public](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences) on GitHub before you try again.

## Migrate an existing account to social login

If you already have a Redis Cloud account that requires an email address and password to sign in, you can migrate your existing account to use a social login associated with that same email address instead.

{{<warning>}}
Once you migrate your account to use social login, you cannot revert to your old email/password sign in method.

1. Choose your preferred account from the list.
