You can define custom Redis ACL rules to assign to a data access role or use predefined Redis ACLs.

Redis provides three predefined ACL rules, which are marked with the Redis logo and can not be changed:

- **Full-Access**: Allows all commands. 
- **Read-Write**: Allows read and write commands and excludes dangerous commands.
- **Read-Only**: Allows read commands only.

ACLs that are not marked with the Redis logo are user-defined ACL rules.

To configure a Redis ACL that you can assign to a data access role:

1. Go to **Data Access Control** from the [Redis Cloud console](https://app.redislabs.com/#/) menu.

    {{<image filename="images/rc/data-access-control-menu.png" width="200px" alt="Menu for database access control." >}}{{< /image >}}

1. Select the **Redis ACLs** tab.

    {{<image filename="images/rc/data-access-control-redis-acls.png" alt="Redis ACLs area." >}}{{< /image >}}

1. Either select `+` to create a new Redis ACL or point to an existing ACL and select the pencil icon to edit it.

    {{<image filename="images/rc/data-access-control-redis-acls-add-or-update.png" width="400px" alt="Add or Update Redis ACL." >}}{{< /image >}}

    {{< note >}}Some of the built-in Redis ACLs are not editable.{{< /note >}}

1. Provide a descriptive name and create the ACL rule [using ACL syntax](#define-permissions-with-acl-syntax).

    {{<image filename="images/rc/data-access-control-redis-acls-add.png" alt="Add Redis ACL." >}}{{< /image >}}

1. Select the check mark to save your changes.  Your new Redis ACL should appear in the list.

    {{<image filename="images/rc/data-access-control-redis-acls-saved.png" alt="Saved Redis ACL." >}}{{< /image >}}

After you create a Redis ACL, you can assign it to a role. Redis ACLs are not fully verified until they are assigned to a role. For more information, see [Create roles]({{<relref "rc/security/access-control/data-access-control/create-roles">}}) or [Active-Active access roles]({{<relref "rc/security/access-control/data-access-control/active-active-roles">}}) for an [Active-Active subscription]({{<relref "rc/databases/active-active-redis">}}).

## Define permissions with ACL syntax

You can define these permissions using the [Redis ACL syntax](https://redis.io/docs/management/security/acl/#acl-rules). This syntax lets you concisely specify which commands, command categories, keys, and pub/sub channels to allow.

- `+` *includes* commands or command categories
- `-` *excludes* commands or command categories
- `@` indicates a command category
- `~` defines a permitted key pattern
- `&` allows access to a [pub/sub channel](https://redis.io/docs/manual/pubsub/)

The Redis Cloud console will validate your ACL syntax while you are typing.

### Command ACL rules

A **command** can be any [Redis command](https://redis.io/commands/).

For example, this Redis ACL rule indicates that the `SET` command is permitted:

```sh
+set
```

### Command category ACL rules

A [**command category**](https://redis.io/docs/management/security/acl/#command-categories) is a predefined, named set of commands.

For example, the Redis commands that
read data are available in the `read` command category. This Redis ACL rule permits access to all read commands:

```sh
+@read
```

To find out which commands are included in the
`read` command category, run the following command with [`redis-cli`]({{<relref "/rs/references/cli-utilities/redis-cli">}}):

```sh
ACL CAT read
```

### Key ACL rules

To specify which **keys** are accessible, use the [key permissions syntax](https://redis.io/docs/management/security/acl/#key-permissions).

The following ACL rule allows access to all keys:

```sh
~*
```

Whereas, this ACL rule only allows access to keys prefixed with `cache:`

```
~cache:*
```

Starting with Redis 7.0, key patterns can also be used to define how a command is able to read or write a key.

The following ACL rule allows you to copy information from keys prefixed with `cache:` into keys prefixed with `app:`:

```text
+@all ~app:* %R~cache:*
```

For more information on how this works, see the [key permissions syntax](https://redis.io/docs/management/security/acl/#key-permissions).

### Pub/sub ACL rules

Pub/sub ACL rules determine which pub/sub channels a user can access. For more information see, [Redis pub/sub](https://redis.io/docs/manual/pubsub/)

For versions older than Redis 7.0, pub/sub is permissive and allows access to all channels by default.

Redis 7.0 makes pub/sub restrictive and blocks access to all channels in open source (OSS) Redis. However, Redis Cloud still defaults to permissive pub/sub even for Redis 7.0 subscriptions.

| Redis<br />version | OSS Redis<br />pub/sub ACLs | Redis Cloud<br />pub/sub ACLs |
|:-------------:|-----------|-------------|
| 6.0 | Not supported | Not supported |
| 6.2 | Permissive | Permissive |
| 7.0 | Restrictive | Permissive |

#### Restrict channel access

To block access to all channels, use the following ACL rule:

```sh
resetchannels
```

If you want to limit access to specific channels, first include `resetchannels`. Then use `&` syntax to allow access to particular channels:

```sh
resetchannels &channel1 &channel2
```

#### Allow all channels

To make pub/sub explicitly permissive and allow users to access all channels, set the following rule:

```sh
allchannels
```

### Selectors

Starting with Redis 7.0, Redis supports adding multiple sets of rules that are evaluated independently of each other, called [selectors](https://redis.io/docs/management/security/acl/#selectors). 

The following ACL rule allows a user to execute `GET` on keys prefixed with `cache` and `SET` on keys prefixed with `app`:

```text
+GET ~cache:* (+SET ~app:*)
```

### Predefined permissions

Redis Cloud includes three predefined permissions:

- Full-Access (`+@all ~*`) - All commands are allowed for all keys.

- Read-Write (`+@all -@dangerous ~*`) - All commands except for the `dangerous` command category are allowed for all keys.

- Read-Only (`+@read ~*`) - Only the `read` command category is allowed for all keys.

### Advanced capability command permissions

Note that you can define permissions for the Redis commands of any advanced capabilities that are part of your subscription;
however, these permissions can only be used for databases that support those capabilities.
