Redis Cloud provides several features to help you secure your databases. These include
[password-based authentication and role-based access control]({{<relref "/rc/security/database-security/passwords-users-roles.md">}}),
[network security]({{<relref "/rc/security/database-security/network-security.md">}}), [TLS]({{<relref "/rc/security/database-security/tls-ssl.md">}}), and [encryption-at-rest]({{<relref "/rc/security/database-security/encryption-at-rest.md">}}).

## Passwords, users, and roles

All Redis Cloud databases [require a password]({{<relref "/rc/security/database-security/passwords-users-roles.md">}}) to connect. However, we recommend going
further by enabling [role-based access control]({{<relref "/rc/security/database-security/passwords-users-roles.md">}}#rolebased-access-control) (RBAC). With RBAC, you can define
all the roles you need, with the appropriate permissions, and assign those roles
to your users.

## Network security

Redis Cloud supports two types of network security: [IP Restrictions]({{< relref "/rc/security/database-security/network-security.md">}}#ip) and [VPCs]({{<relref "/rc/security/database-security/network-security.md">}}#virtual-private-clouds). We recommend that you employ that least one of these network security options to constrain access to your databases.

## Transport Layer Security (TLS)

Redis Cloud supports [Transport Layer Security]({{<relref "/rc/security/database-security/tls-ssl.md">}}) (TLS) for database connections. TLS, often called "SSL", ensures the privacy the TCP connection between your application and database. When client
authentication is enabled, TLS also ensures that those clients with an authorized key can connect to your Redis databases.
We strongly recommend that you enable TLS for any application trasmitting sensitive data across the wire.

## Disk encryption

Redis Cloud provides encrpytion for all data stored on disk in Redis databases. See our [encrpytion at rest documentation]({{<relref "/rc/security/database-security/encryption-at-rest.md">}}) for specific details.
