All Redis Cloud databases require either [password-based authentication](#password-based-authentication) or [role-based access control](#role-based-access-control).
Role-based access control allows you to define multiple users with fine-grained authorization features.

To use role-based access control, you need a Redis Cloud database supporting version 6.0.0 and above. You
can check your database's Redis version by navigating to the **View Database** screen...

![View Database](/images/rc/view-database-extended.png "View Database")

..and then scrolling down to the **Redis Version Compliance** field:

## Password-based Authentication {#passwordbased-authentication}

Password-based authentication is a basic but essential Redis security feature. When you create a Redis Cloud database,
your database is given a randomly generated password. You can see this password on the **View Database** screen.

![Default User Password](/images/rc/default-user-password.png "Default User Password")

Click the ![Password View Icon](/images/rc/icon_view.png "Default User Password") icon to see your password and copy it.

![Default User Password Reveal](/images/rc/default-user-password-reveal.png "Default User Password Reveal")

You'll need to use this password whenever you connect to your database using a Redis client. For example,
in the Redis CLI, you use the AUTH command to provide this password:

```sh
AUTH 4kTtH2ddXfN2sFmXE6sowOLukxiaJhN8n
```

See your Redis client's documentation for specifics on how to provide your password when connecting.

### Changing the Password

To change your Redis database password:

1. From the **View Database** screen, click ![Edit](/images/rc/icon_edit.png#no-click "Edit"):

![Edit Database](/images/rc/view-edit.png "Edit Database")

2. Scroll down to **Access Control & Security**, and enter the new password:

![Edit Password](/images/rc/edit-password.png "Edit Password")

3. Click **Update** to save your changes.

## Role-Based Access Control {#rolebased-access-control}

Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access-control mechanism that allows you to define *roles* with specific sets of *permissions*. You can then assign *users* to these roles
to provide appropriate levels of access.

RBAC effectively lets you implement the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege). For example, you can provide
read-only access to an application whose only job is to display Redis data. Similarly, you can prevent new developers from running dangerous administrative commands.

### Setting Up RBAC

To set up RBAC, first navigate to the **Data Access Control** screen.

![Data Access Control](/images/rc/data-access-control.png "Data Access Control")

There are three tabs on this screen: **Users**, **Roles**, and **Redis ACLs**.

In the **Redis ACLs** tab, you define named *permissions* for specific Redis commands and keys.

In the **Roles** tab, you create roles. Each role consists of a set of permissions for a one or more Redis Cloud databases.

Finally, in the **Users** tab, you create users, and you assign each user a role.

#### OSS Redis ACLs vs. Redis Cloud RBAC

In open source Redis, you can create users and assign ACLs to them using the `ACL` command. However, open source
Redis does not support generic roles.

In Redis Cloud, you configure RBAC using the admin console. As a result, certain open source Redis ACL
subcommands are not available in Redis Cloud.

Specifically, Redis Cloud databases block the following ACL subcommands: `LOAD`, `SAVE`, `SETUSER`, `DELUSER`, `GENPASS`, and `LOG`.

Redis Cloud databases allow these ACL subcommands: `LIST`, `USERS`, `GETUSER`, `CAT`, `WHOAMI`, and `HELP`.

In open source Redis, you must explicitly provide access to the `MULTI`, `EXEC`, and `DISCARD` commands.
In Redis Cloud, these commands, which are used in transactions, are always permitted. However, the commands
run within the transaction block are subject to RBAC permissions.

When you run multi-key commands on multi-slot keys, the return value is `failure` but the command runs on the keys that are allowed.

### Defining Permissions

To define permissions, go to the **Redis ACLs** tab of the **Data Access Control** page.

![Redis ACLs](/images/rc/redis-acls.png "Redis ACLs")

You define these named permissions using the [Redis ACL syntax](https://redis.io/topics/acl#acl-rules). This
syntax allows you to concisely specify **commands**, **command categories**, and **keys** that should be permitted.

A **command** can be any Redis command. Take the `SET` command, for example. The Redis ACL rule

```sh
+set
```

indicates that the `SET` command is permitted.

A **command category** is a predefined, named set of commands. For example, the Redis commands that
read data are available in the `read` command category. The Redis ACL rule

```sh
+@read
```

permits access to all read commands. If you'd like to know which commands are included in the
`read` command category, run

```sh
ACL CAT read
```

from the Redis CLI.

There's also a syntax for specifying which **keys** can be accessed. For example,

```sh
~*
```

indicates that all keys can be accessed. Whereas

```
~cache:*
```

indicates that only those keys beginning with the prefix `cache:` can be accessed.

The Redis ACL syntax emphasizes brevity:

- `+` *includes* commands or command categories
- `-` *excludes* commands or command categories
- `@` indicates a command category
- `~` defines a permitted key pattern

Redis Cloud includes three, pre-defined permissions:

- Full Access (`+@all ~*`) - All commands are allowed for all keys
- Not Dangerous (`+@all -@dangerous ~*`) - All commands except for the "dangerous" command category are allowed for all keys
- Read Only (`+@read ~*`) - Only the "read" command category is allowed for all keys

Note that you can define permissions for the Redis module commands of any modules that are loaded on the subscription;
however, these permissions can only be used for databases that support those modules.

To define database access control, you can either:

- Use the predefined data access roles and add Redis ACLs to them for specific databases.
- Create new data access roles and select the management roles and Redis ACLs that apply to the roles for specific databases.
- Assign roles and Redis ACLs to a database in the access control list section of the [database configuration]({{< relref "/rc/administration/setup/create-database.md" >}}).

### Configuring Permissions using Redis ACLs

To configure a Redis ACL that you can assign to a data access role:

1. In **Data Access Control** > **Redis ACLs**:
    - Edit an existing Redis ACL - Hover over a Redis ACL and click ![Edit](/images/rc/icon_edit.png#no-click "Edit").
    - Create a new Redis ACL - Click ![Add](/images/rc/icon_add.png#no-click "Add").
1. Enter a descriptive name for the Redis ACL.
1. Enter the [ACL syntax](https://redis.io/topics/acl#acl-rules) of the command or click **Rule Builder** to use the form to build the command:
    1. For the commands:
        1. Select to include or exclude the command or category.
        1. Enter the [ACL syntax](https://redis.io/topics/acl#acl-rules) that defines the commands.
            - To add more command definitions, click ![Add](/images/rc/icon_add.png#no-click "Add").
            - All entries in the Commands/Categories column apply to the keys defined in the Keys column.
    1. For the keys, enter the [ACL syntax](https://redis.io/topics/acl#acl-rules) that defines the keys.
        - To add more key definitions, click ![Add](/images/rc/icon_add.png#no-click "Add").
    1. Click **Save Rule**.
1. Click **Save**.

### Assigning Permissions to a Role

To assign Redis ACLs to a data access role:
