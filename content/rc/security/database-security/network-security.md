Redis Enterprise Cloud supports two types of network security: database-level CIDR allow lists and [VPC](#virtual-private-clouds)-wide CIDR allow lists.

These features are available in most Redis Cloud configurations, as shown here:

| Cloud&nbsp;provider | VPC peering | IP restrictions |
|:-------------------:|-------------|-----------------|
| AWS | Flexible and Annual | Fixed (paid), Flexible, and Annual |
| Google Cloud | Flexible and Annual | Fixed (paid), Flexible, and Annual |
| Azure | Annual | Annual |

## IP and subnet restrictions {#ip}

You can restrict database access to a configurable
set of source IP addresses and subnets. This is roughly equivalent
to using [iptables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables) to limit access to a host.

To restrict a database to a specific set of source IP addresses or subnets, see [Configure CIDR allow list]({{<relref "/rc/security/cidr-whitelist">}}).

## Virtual private clouds

A [Virtual Private Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_cloud) (VPC) is an isolated set of resources within a [public cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Public_cloud), usually having its own subnets and VLAN.

Databases in Flexible and Annual subscriptions are almost always deployed in a Redis VPC. In most cases, you'll need to create a [VPC peering connection]({{<relref "/rc/security/vpc-peering">}}) to access these databases. A VPC peering connection allows unrestricted network access between two VPCs.

Connection creation and supported features vary by public cloud provider. Learn more about VPC usage for [AWS](#vpcs-with-aws), [Google Cloud](#vpcs-with-google-cloud), and [Azure](#vpcs-with-azure).

### VPCs with AWS

Subscriptions that run on AWS support two VPC options. To ensure that that you can securely connect to your database, you need to [create a VPC peering connection]({{<relref "/rc/security/vpc-peering#aws-vpc-peering">}}).

If you create a VPC peering connection, you can also [configure a CIDR allow list]({{<relref "/rc/security/cidr-whitelist">}}) to allow connections only from specific IP address blocks or security groups.

### VPCs with Google Cloud

Subscriptions that run on Google Cloud *require* a VPC peering connection. See [Google Cloud VPC peering]({{<relref "/rc/security/vpc-peering#gcp-vpc-peering">}}) to learn how to set up VPC peering for Google Cloud.

### VPCs with Azure

When you request a Redis Cloud Annual subscription, all databases will be deployed in your own Azure VPC.
