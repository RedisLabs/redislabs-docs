The admin console is the web application you use to manage your Redis Cloud deployments. To increase the security of your deployments, you need to take steps to secure the admin console. This means:

* [Managing admin console users]({{<relref "/rc/security/admin-console-security/user-team-management.md">}}) and their roles
* Enabling [multi-factor authentication]({{<relref "/rc/security/admin-console-security/multi-factor-authentication.md">}})
