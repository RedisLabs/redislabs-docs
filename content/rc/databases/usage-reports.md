The **Usage Report** shows the daily memory usage and shard usage of all databases from the subscriptions associated with your account.

To filter the data, you can:
* Select a month and year from the **View Statement For** list to view the daily memory usage during a specific month.
* Select a subscription from the **Subscription** list to view the daily memory usage of a specific subscription associated with your account.
* Select a database from the **Database** list to view the daily memory usage of a specific database.

You can also hold the pointer over each bar in the graph to view the precise memory usage on that day.
