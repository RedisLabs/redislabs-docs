A database is the heart of any Redis Cloud deployment. 

The process for Creating a database depends on the type of [subscription]({{<relref "/rc/subscriptions">}}) you need.

An **Essentials** subscription is a fixed monthly price for a single database. It is cost-efficient and designed for low-throughput scenarios. It supports a range of availability, persistence, and backup options. Pricing supports low throughput workloads.
- [Create an Essentials database]({{<relref "/rc/databases/create-database/create-essentials-database">}})

A **Pro** subscription is an hourly price based on capacity. It supports more databases, larger databases, greater throughput, and unlimited connections. 
- [Create a Pro database with a new subscription]({{<relref "/rc/databases/create-database/create-pro-database-new">}})
- [Create a Pro database in an existing subscription]({{<relref "/rc/databases/create-database/create-pro-database-existing">}})
