Use the **Databases** menu of the Redis Cloud console to manage your subscription databases.

To view the details of a database:

1. Sign in to the [Redis Cloud console](https://app.redislabs.com/).  (Create an account if you don't already have one.)

2. Select the **Databases** menu to display a searchable list of all databases.
 
3. Locate the database in the list.

4. Select the database name to open the **Database** page.

    {{<image filename="images/rc/database-details-configuration-tab-general-flexible.png" alt="The Configuration tab of the Database details screen." >}}{{< /image >}}

The **Database** screen lets you review:
- Configuration details of a database
- Graphs showing performance metrics
- Recent activity via a "[slowlog](https://redis.io/commands/slowlog)," which lists queries that exceed a certain execution time.

For help changing database settings, see [Edit database details](#edit-database-details).

## Configuration tab

The **Configuration** screen is divided into sections, each dedicated to a specific category.  Note that not every section or setting is available to every [subscription plan]({{< relref "rc/subscriptions/" >}}).

### General settings

The **General** section defines basic properties about your database.

The available settings vary according to your subscription plan, cloud provider, and design choices.  For example, if you do not select an Advanced Capability when creating a database, the **Advanced Capabilities** setting is not displayed when you view its configuration details.

| Setting name              | Description                                                                                                                                                 |

### Scalability section

The **Scalability** section describes the memory size, throughput, and hashing policy for a database.

{{<image filename="images/rc/database-details-configuration-tab-scalability-flexible.png" alt="Use the Scalability section to control the size, throughput, and hashing policy for a database." >}}{{< /image >}}

The **Scalability** section is primarily for Flexible and Annual plans. Free and Fixed plans have options for memory limit and memory used.

|:----------------------|:----------|
| **Plan Memory limit** | Maximum size (in GB) for your database |
| **Memory used**       | Memory currently used for your database  |
| **Throughput**        | Defines throughput in terms of maximum operations per second for the database <br/><br/>Databases with search and query enabled use the number of shards to determine throughput. To determine how many shards you need for your database, use the [sizing calculator](https://redis.com/modules/redis-search/redisearch-sizing-calculator/). | |
| **Hashing policy**    | Defines the [hashing policy]({{< relref "/rc/databases/configuration/clustering#manage-the-hashing-policy" >}})  |
| **OSS Cluster API**       | Enables the [OSS Cluster API]({{< relref "/rc/databases/create-database#oss-cluster-api" >}}) for a database<br/><br/>When this option is enabled, you cannot define a custom hashing policy|

To learn more about these settings and when to use them, see [Database clustering]({{< relref "/rs/databases/durability-ha/clustering.md" >}}).

### Durability section

The Durability section helps protect your data when problems occur.  These settings define replication, persistence, backup, and eviction policies.

{{<image filename="images/rc/database-details-configuration-tab-durability-flexible.png" alt="Use the Durability  section to protect your data from unexpected problems." >}}{{< /image >}}

| Setting name             | Description                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Remote backup**        | When enabled, identifies a location and interval for [data backups]({{< relref "/rc/databases/back-up-data.md" >}}). (_paid subscriptions only_)                |
| **Active-Passive Redis** | When enabled, identifies a path to the linked database. (_Flexible or Annual subscriptions only_)                                                               |

### Security section

The **Security** section helps you control access to your database.

{{<image filename="images/rc/database-details-configuration-tab-security-flexible.png" alt="Use the Security settings to control access to your database." >}}{{< /image >}}


|Setting name| Description                                                                                                                                                                    |

{{<image filename="images/rc/database-details-configuration-tab-alerts-flexible.png" alt="The Alerts section defines the notification emails and their triggering conditions." >}}{{< /image >}}

The available alerts vary according to the subscription type.

|Setting name| Description                                                                                                                                   |
|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Replica Of - database unable to sync with source** | When enabled, sends email when the replica database cannot sync with the primary (source) database _(Flexible or Annuals plans only_)         |
| **Replica Of - sync lag is higher than** | When enabled, sends email when the sync lag exceeds the defined threshold _(Flexible or Annuals plans only_)                                  |

### Danger zone

Actions in the **Danger Zone** are permanent and should not be taken lightly.

{{<image filename="images/rc/database-details-configuration-tab-danger-flexible.png" alt="The Danger Zone includes activities that impact data, such as deleting a database.  Use with care." >}}{{< /image >}}

Here, you can:

- Delete the database.

    Databases must be active and empty before they can be deleted.  To learn more, see [Delete a database]({{< relref "/rc/databases/delete-database.md" >}}).

- Import data into the database.

    When you choose this action, you're asked to specify the source and location of the data to import

    {{<image filename="images/rc/database-import-dialog.png" alt="The Import data dialog helps you import data into a database." >}}{{< /image >}}

    To learn more, see [Import data]({{< relref "/rc/databases/import-data.md" >}}).

For best results, we recommend backing up data before starting any **Danger Zone** actions.

## Manage the database list

The **Databases** list summarizes the status of all databases from the subscriptions associated with your account.  

You can:

- Search by typing into the search box located above the database list.

    {{<image filename="images/rc/database-list-search.png" alt="Use the search bar to filter the list." >}}{{< /image >}}

- Filter by selecting a filter type and then selecting the checkbox next to the options you want to include from the dropdown.  Select the Filter toggle, located on the right of the search bar, if the filter types are hidden.

    {{<image filename="images/rc/database-list-filter.png" alt="Use the filter toggle to display filter options." >}}{{< /image >}}

    You can filter the list on **Status**, **Subscription**, **Capabilities**, **Options**, and **Tags**.  String matches are _not_ case-sensitive.  You can specify more than one filter expression at a time.  

    A list of selected filters appears below the filter types.

    To remove a filter click the **x** to the right of the name of that filter.  To remove all filters, select **Clear all**.

    {{<image filename="images/rc/database-list-filter-selected.png" alt="Use the filter toggle to display filter options." >}}{{< /image >}}

- Sort the list in descending or ascending order using the arrow displayed to right of the field name in the header.  Supported fields include **Subscription**, **Database name**, **Memory**, and **Tags**.

    {{<image filename="images/rc/icon-database-list-sort-ascending.png" alt="Use the arrows in the list header to sort the list." >}}{{< /image >}} {{<image filename="images/rc/icon-database-list-sort-descending.png" alt="The direction of the arrow corresponds to the direction of the sort." >}}{{< /image >}}

    Select the arrow icon to change the sort order.  One sort order can be active at any given time.

- Use the controls in the list footer to change the number of items displayed in the list or to navigate.

Sort orders and filter expressions are not saved between console sessions.

## Other actions and info

The **View Database** screen also has tabs that let you view:

- **Metrics**: a series of graphs showing database performance over time.  See [Monitor performance]({{< relref "/rc/databases/monitor-performance.md" >}})

- **Slowlog**: a log showing recent [slow queries](https://redis.io/commands/slowlog) run against your database.  The log displays when the action started, the duration, the complexity of the operation, and any parameters passed to the operation.


## Edit database details

Use the **Edit database** button to edit database details.

{{<image filename="images/rc/button-database-edit.png" alt="The Edit database button lets you change selected database properties." >}}{{< /image >}}

Because databases exist within the context of a deployment, certain fields cannot be updated, especially those that might lead to data loss.

Here's what you can change:

| Section | Setting                        | Comments |
|:-----------|:-------------------------------|:---------|
| General | Database name                  ||

| | Default user password          |
| | CIDR allow list                | _paid Fixed, Flexible, and Annual subscriptions only_ |
| | Transport layer security (TLS) | _Flexible and Annual subscriptions only_ |
| Alerts | all available for subscription |

Choose **Save database** to save your changes.

{{<image filename="images/rc/button-database-save.png" alt="Use the Save database button to save database changes." >}}{{< /image >}}

If you need to change other details, create a new database and then migrate existing data.
