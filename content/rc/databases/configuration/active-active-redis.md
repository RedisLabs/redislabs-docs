Active-Active databases store data across multiple regions and availability zones.  This improves scalability, performance, and availability, especially when compared to standalone databases.

To create Active-Active databases, you need a Redis Cloud Pro subscription that enables Active-Active Redis and defines the regions for each copy of your databases. See [Create an Active-Active database]({{<relref "/rc/databases/create-database/create-active-active-database">}}) for instructions.

Active-Active databases are distributed across multiple regions (geo-distribution).  This improves performance by reducing latency for nearby users and improves availability by protecting against data loss in case of network or resource failure.

Active-Active databases allow read and write operations in each copy.  Each copy eventually reflects changes made in other copies ([eventual consistency]({{<relref "/glossary#eventual-consistency">}})).  Conflict-free data types (CRDTs) synchronize read and write operations between copies.  CRDTs ensure consistency and resolve conflicts.

## Active-Active geo-distributed replication highlights

### Multi-zone

Geo-distributed replication maintains copies of both primary and replica shards in multiple clusters. These clusters can be spread across multiple availability zones. Active-Active Redis uses zone awareness to spread your primary and replica shards across zones, which helps protect against data loss from regional outages.

### Local latency with unique endpoints

Applications can connect to a specific copy of an Active-Active database using its unique endpoint. For local latency, configure your application to use a database endpoint in the closest region.

### Conflict resolution

Active-Active databases use special data types called conflict-free data types (CRDT). These automatically resolve conflicts that occur when writes are made to different clusters at the same time.

### Failover handling

After a failure at the process, node, or zone level, Active-Active databases automatically promote replica shards to replace failed primaries, copy data to new replica shards, and migrate shards to new nodes as needed. This reduces downtime and makes the most of your computing resources, even in the event of a failure.  

Active-Active also provides a failover opportunity in case an entire cluster fails. Applications should redirect traffic to another cluster in the Active-Active deployment if a connected cluster fails. After the original cluster recovers, applications can direct traffic back to the original cluster. Redirecting traffic to alternate clusters is not handled automatically by Active-Active, so you must add redirection logic to the application. However, data automatically syncs to a recovered cluster when it returns to a healthy state.
