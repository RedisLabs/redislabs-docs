Redis Labs documentation is an open source project and we welcome contributions of all types.

Just to get you started, here is a simple explanation of how to contribute.

## Getting to the Source

1. Find a page with something to edit.

    Contributions can be anything from a simple typo or grammar error to an entire How To guide.

1. On that page, click **Edit on GitHub**.

1. Enter your GitHub credentials.

    If you don't have an account, it is easy and free to open one.

Here's what this process looks like:

## Make the Change

1. Fork the repository.

    A fork is a copy of the entire contents of the documentation site that is stored in your account.

1. In the source file of the page, edit the text as you like.

    Don't worry. This is your copy of the file, so you can't do much damage.

    You can use the [markdown cheatsheet]({{< relref "cheatsheet.md" >}}) for help with more complex editing.

## Propose the Change

1. When you finish with your changes, scroll down to the bottom of the page.
1. Enter a meaningful name for the change that you made.

    The default is "Update <filename>" but we like a little more detail than that if you can.

1. Click **Propose file change**.

## Open a Pull Request

1. Review your changes.

    You can see the before and after of the file. If you see a mistake or want to add to the change, just go back.

2. Click **Create pull request**.

    A pull request is a recommendation that includes the changes that you made. We are notified of all request and can review or change the request before we include it in the documentation.

3. Enter a meaningful name for the pull request.

    By default the pull request has the same name as your file change, which is usually fine.

4. Click **Create pull request**.

    Now your pull request is in our system and ready for us to handle.

5. You can add information in the comments box to help us understand why you think the change is important.

    Maybe we'll even write back!
